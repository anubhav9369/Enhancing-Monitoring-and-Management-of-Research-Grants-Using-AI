 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program, located at an undergraduate institution, features hands-on, table-top experiments using lasers and heated atomic samples to measure with great accuracy certain properties of complex atomic systems. These experimental results can then be compared to state-of-the-art models with which theoretical physicists can predict these same properties.  With better understanding of the workings of these particular atoms, it is possible for future laboratory experiments to use such atoms as tools to provide insights to some of the most profound questions facing science today \u2013 including the nature of dark matter in the universe and the possible presence of new elementary particles not yet discovered. In the PI\u2019s laboratory, experiments proceed with the aid of talented undergraduate researchers, many getting their first taste of science research. Students become involved in all aspects of the experimental work, building and testing apparatus, designing new experiments, and carrying out data collection and sophisticated data analysis procedures. \r\n\r\nOver recent decades, highly precise atomic physics experiments using laser spectroscopy have contributed important insights into the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics.  Such low-energy physics tests complement accelerator-based experimental work as well as observational astronomy searches.  The tiny size of these effects demands very high precision, extensive study of potential errors, and careful experimental design.  Therefore, the precise experiments must be paired with equally precise theoretical models of the atomic wavefunctions, which are required to distinguish the \u2018ordinary\u2019 quantum mechanical behavior from the \u2018exotic\u2019 physics phenomena being targeted.  In the PI\u2019s research laboratory, the group is pursuing an ongoing series of diode laser spectroscopy measurements of the atomic properties of Group III and Group IV multi-valence atoms (thallium, indium, lead, tin) which can be compared to state-of-the-art atomic theory calculations. Atoms are studied both in heated vapor cells and in an atomic-beam apparatus housed in a large, evacuated chamber.  These atoms contain three or four valence electrons, challenging the approximation techniques required to accurately compute wavefunctions.  This experiment-theory interplay has resulted in significantly improved accuracy in recent years and has impacted the importance of these atomic-physics-based experiments. With funding from the current grant, the PI will collaborate with a junior faculty colleague to demonstrate laser cooling in lead atoms \u2013 an experimental technique that has long facilitated high-precision measurements in many atomic systems, but which has never been applied to the lead atom.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
