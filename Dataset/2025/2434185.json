 "awd_abstract_narration": "The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) strand allows TCUP institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM instruction and research. A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the intellectual leadership of TCUP institutions so that they can address scientific or engineering needs or interests, specifically for their tribes or communities, or broadly for the Nation. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will impact the economic strength of the Three Affiliated Tribes by fostering new STEM employment opportunities and, through multiple pathways, providing the high-skilled workforce required for those opportunities, in partnership with Tribal agencies and STEM professionals. \r\n\r\nWith this award, Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC) takes a leading role in training technicians to assist scientists in surveys that are geographic or agricultural in nature, in order to sustain the Tribes\u2019 land base.  The efforts and services provided by NHSC faculty and students include restoration of traditional plants, to promote food security remote communities. \r\n\r\nThis project also aims to serve the national interest by producing more qualified technicians to meet workforce demands in ecological monitoring. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
