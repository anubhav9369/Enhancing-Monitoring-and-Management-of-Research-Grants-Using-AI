 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract:\r\nThis project lays a foundation for fully synthetic, lab-made membranes that can mimic the uniquely useful functions performed by the membranes of living cells. Instead of being powered and driven by active proteins, however, these new membranes are powered and driven by light: they are photoswitchable. In the future, these membranes could form the basis of artificial cells with organelle-like compartments to carry out designed biochemical reactions, release or take in chemical reagents and products, stir to enhance reaction rates, and even move in response to stimuli - all driven by light. Synthetic materials based on this science might lead to new products for skin care and for self-cleaning or protective coatings. This project uses lipid molecules that resemble those found in cells, with the crucial addition of an azobenzene group in one of the oily tails of each molecule. When exposed to light, the tails isomerize, i.e., change from an approximately straight to a sharply bent shape. Exposure to light of a different color shifts the tails back to their original shape. This bending causes the lipids to push or pull against one another, leading to transient compression or tension in the membrane. The light-induced molecular forces thereby cause dramatic changes of the membrane\u2019s shape, drive fluid flow, and briefly allow exchange of molecules across the membrane. This three-year project includes fabricating membranes, exciting them with light, and using optical microscopy to observe their shape, permeability, elasticity, and other properties. Membranes that are fluid in the plain (like cell membranes) are compared to membranes that contain solid regions, which tend to form creases (like crumpled paper). Patterned light illumination is used to develop ways to drive membrane motion or fluid flow in a chosen direction. The project includes theoretical modeling, leading to the design rules for future materials. College and graduate students learn skills and gain experience for careers in research and development. The project also provides formal courses in the topic of soft and bio-inspired materials and engages middle-school students from a nearby school in the excitement of research. \r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\nThis project creates new basic science toward the goal of active, bio-inspired responsive materials based on photoisomerizing lipid molecules assembled into a membrane. Photoisomerization of these lipids causes a reversible bending of one of the lipid tails. This bending in turn creates transient compressive or tensile stress in the membrane as lipids push or pull one another to reach their new equilibrium spacing. Depending on the rate of excitation, photo-induced stresses can excite undulations, multi-lobed shapes, finger-like pseudopods, or topological changes, and can also switch membrane permeability. The project\u2019s first aim focuses on in-plane stresses and flows generated in fluid membranes. These studies show the mechanism leading to transient deformation modes and the cross-over to a spontaneously localized pseudopod-like shape. The second aim focuses on membranes that contain solid (gel-phase) domains. Experiments investigate how domain morphology determines the photo-induced response, ranging from plastic crumpling to inward endocytosis-like budding. The third aim uses spatially patterned light intensity to induce a programmed set of membrane shapes, creating fluid flows that enhance diffusive mixing of nearby particles or cause directional displacement of the vesicles. Results will inform continuum-scale theory to show how molecular conformations lead to non-equilibrium macroscopic changes. The project provides graduate and undergraduate students with training for careers in research and development. Teaching in formal classes and annual summer schools expose students to leading topics in soft and biological materials. Activities include the UMass Summer School on Soft Solids and Complex Fluids; two new forms of training undergraduates in bio-inspired materials; and co-hosting an annual field trip for 8th graders at a nearby school.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
