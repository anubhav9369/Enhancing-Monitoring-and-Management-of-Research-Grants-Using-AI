 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging research institutions (ERIs) and primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) play a vital role in the national research ecosystem, yet many lack the infrastructure to maximize faculty research potential and community partnerships. This planning project at the University of Evansville (UE) will design an innovative Grants Development Office (GDO) that integrates university research capacity with regional economic development through new public-private partnerships. The planned GDO will serve as both a faculty support hub and a catalyst for cross-sector collaboration, aligning university research with workforce development and economic innovation goals in Southwestern Indiana. This approach advances the national interest by promoting scientific progress, supporting economic prosperity, and creating a replicable model for increasing access to the research enterprise. The collaborative planning process will engage faculty, community stakeholders, and economic development leaders to ensure the GDO is scalable and grounded in national best practices, generating transferable strategies for how ERIs can strengthen both institutional and regional research capacity.\r\n\r\nThis GRANTED planning project will develop a comprehensive strategic framework for establishing a GDO at the UE through three integrated objectives: (1) forming a two-tiered advisory structure\u2014an Internal Advisory Board with faculty representatives from all three colleges and a Community Advisory Council with regional economic development leaders\u2014and convene both groups to guide the planning process; (2) conducting a systematic needs assessment utilizing surveys and focus groups to identify faculty research support needs, community priorities, and best practices in grant development; and (3) synthesizing findings into an actionable plan for the GDO, including the evaluation of scalable digital tools and electronic research administration systems to support collaborative operations. External partners include the Evansville Regional Economic Partnership, the City of Evansville, and the Applied Research Institute's Opportunity Indiana initiative, providing expertise in regional development and public-private collaboration. Expected outcomes include a data-informed implementation blueprint with an accompanying logic model and strengthened cross-sector partnerships with documented partnership functioning metrics that will provide a basis for the subsequent development of a competitive full GRANTED proposal focused on testing implementation of innovative university\u2013industry grant collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
