 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to establish the Center for Smart Manufacturing at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. By harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence, the project will address critical challenges in efficiency, safety in human-robot collaboration, cybersecurity, and the shortage of advanced technical skills in modern manufacturing. The importance of this work lies in the need for manufacturing systems to evolve in order to meet growing demands for productivity, sustainability, and resilience. The project will unite researchers and industry experts to advance new methods and technologies that enhance predictability, optimize operations, and strengthen the reliability of U.S. manufacturing systems. The outcomes will contribute to new knowledge in smart manufacturing and provide advanced training opportunities for students, reinforcing the national workforce and supporting the long-term competitiveness of U.S. industry.\r\n \r\nThe specific goals of the project are to develop and integrate four research thrusts within a cyber-physical manufacturing facility: (1) a digital twin-based factory with embedded artificial intelligence and two-way data exchange to improve safety and efficiency; (2) virtual and augmented reality approaches that improve human-system integration through adaptive training; (3) robotics and automation methods for autonomous manipulation in dynamic environments; and (4) artificial intelligence\u2013enhanced cybersecurity protocols that strengthen communication standards and device authentication. The research scope will include both fundamental studies and applied solutions that enable secure, sustainable, and efficient manufacturing systems. Results will be disseminated through publications, workshops, conferences, and a dedicated center website, ensuring wide access to findings. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
