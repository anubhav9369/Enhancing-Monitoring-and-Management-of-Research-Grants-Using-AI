 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of a modular energy conversion system that harnesses ambient environmental forces to generate electrical energy. The innovation leverages programmable architected materials that respond to geothermal gradients, wave motion, and structural vibrations, enabling energy harvesting in locations where conventional systems, such as solar or fuel-based generators, are impractical. The system is designed for deployment in remote or disaster-prone areas, such as coastal communities, off-grid sites, or buried utility corridors. Unlike traditional infrastructure, this technology operates independent of the electrical grid and requires minimal maintenance. The market need for such solutions is growing rapidly due to increasing threats from extreme weather, rising demand for resilient off-grid systems, and efforts to expand energy sources. By harnessing compact and scalable energy sources from underutilized natural forces, this technology enhances national health and welfare through improved energy access, enhanced emergency preparedness, and more adaptable infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of architected materials that convert environmental stimuli into mechanical energy through controlled deformation. Fabricated using additive manufacturing, these materials feature programmable, instability-driven transitions that enable them to absorb, store, and release energy in response to dynamic environmental inputs. A physics-informed design framework enables the tuning of mechanical response to match specific input conditions, such as frequency, amplitude, and direction. To enhance portability and ease of deployment, an origami- inspired folding strategy enables compact transport and rapid activation in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
