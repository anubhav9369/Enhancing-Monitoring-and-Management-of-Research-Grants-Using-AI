 "awd_abstract_narration": "Defining a design problem is the catalyst for the engineering design process itself. Problem statements create a shared mental model for engineers and stakeholders, shaping the trajectory of subsequent design decisions. This critical framing of the problem to be solved is often established during the fuzzy front end of design, when project expectations and team understanding are still evolving. Problem formulations can exist in many different forms \u2014 such as lists of goals, value models, constraints, or requirements \u2014 and each form can introduce biases that predispose engineers towards certain decisions, potentially limiting creativity. However, isolating the effect of design problem formulation is challenging due to moderating variables like problem domain and complexity. This research seeks to use controlled experiments with engineering students and practitioners to investigate how problem formulation influences design exploration and decision-making. Findings looks to inform the development of evidence-based guidance to improve problem formulation practices, with the potential to reduce design cycle times in both educational and industrial settings, ultimately enhancing U.S. economic competitiveness. The project also seeks to promote industry adoption through practitioner workshops and close collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis project looks to advance our understanding by addressing three critical research questions: In what ways do problem formulation styles affect exploration in the design process and creativity of design outcomes? In what ways does problem complexity affect the use of problem formulation styles? In what ways do designer attributes affect the use of problem formulation styles? The research centers on controlled experimentation, placing the designer at the core of analysis. To capture a comprehensive view of the design process, both process and outcome metrics will be assessed, including design time, idea generation, design space exploration, and creativity of outcomes. By quantifying how formulation styles impact creativity and exploration\u2014and how designer experience moderates these effects\u2014this project intends to generate actionable insights to guide effective design practices across academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
