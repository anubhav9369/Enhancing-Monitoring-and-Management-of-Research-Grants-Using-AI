 "awd_abstract_narration": "The East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS) is an annual research conference centered around the theory of operator algebras and their applications. The first meeting was at Vanderbilt University in the Fall of 2003, and since then meetings have occurred annually. This award will partially support participants for this year's event, the 21st meeting of ECOAS, held at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, tentatively scheduled for October 10-11, 2025. The conference will provide a venue for researchers to learn about developments at the forefront of operator algebras, share their work with the broader community, and network with both early career researchers and well-established members of the community. \r\n\r\nThis event focuses on C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras and a wide variety of applications, including to quantum physics, representation theory, and dynamical systems. Thirty to sixty participants are expected. The plenary speakers will review recent advances, enabling participants to keep abreast of recent developments in a vast and rapidly expanding subject. More information is available at the conference website: https://math.unl.edu/east-coast-operator-algebras-symposium-2025/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
