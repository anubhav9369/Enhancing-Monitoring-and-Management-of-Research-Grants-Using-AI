 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation at the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) Workshop at the Ohio State University on June 3-5, 2025. It gathers well-established researchers, as well as those new to the field of SPDEs, and aims to provide a stimulating and learning environment for all to share their results and obtain recognition for their work. One of its main goals is to offer sufficient time for the participants to conduct in deep discussions of their results and find possible collaborators.\r\n\r\nBy adding a term representing the \u201cnoise\u201d and what cannot be controlled in the system, SPDEs offer more realistic versions of the classical, deterministic and well-known equations studied in Physics. This workshop focuses on recent developments regarding the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of solutions to such equations and discusses some of their applications in queuing theory, finance and population models. There are 24 confirmed speakers and about 15 other participants who have registered or have expressed interest in joining the workshop. The group consists of senior researchers, postdocs and graduate students and aims to provide the setting for all, regardless of rank, to explore topics in the field of SPDEs and find new problems to pursue. With the permission of each speaker, each talk will be recorded and made available online on the workshop\u2019s website for the mathematics community to benefit from. All related information on this workshop may be found on its website: https://u.osu.edu/spdeworkshop/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
