 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of TCUP-eligible institutions. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may serve as a model and impetus for similar institutions of higher education to develop post-baccalaureate degree programs. The connection of faculty to the development of novel opportunities for programs of study that ensure successful transfer to local employment, particularly tribal employment, demonstrates the essentiality of engaging full-time, credentialed STEM faculty devoted to a specific strand of study and preparation. \r\n\r\nThis project provides an accredited STEM master\u2019s of science (MS) degree option in environmental sciences at Oglala Lakota College (OLC) for students who then are prepared for scientific and management roles at local, particularly Tribal, organizations, as well as faculty positions at the local colleges, including OLC. The MS project builds on a well-established bachelor\u2019s degree (BS) in environmental sciences, which has been a popular degree choice for OLC students and led to their early engagement in research. The project contributes to the achievement of alignment of Lakota knowledge into Western STEM knowledge.  It also engages pre-college students in college preparation in STEM, which will continue to build the local STEM infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
