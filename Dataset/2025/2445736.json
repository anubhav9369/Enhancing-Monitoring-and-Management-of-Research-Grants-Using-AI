 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clean water resources play an important role in the life of rural communities. Set in the context of low-income communities in West Virginia and Delaware, this project aims to foster elementary school students' understanding of local watershed ecosystems, addressing critical environmental challenges while sparking interest in environmental-STEM (E-STEM) careers. To achieve these aims, the project enhances an existing \"Shared Waters\" curriculum by integrating local outdoor learning with new tools including augmented reality, mixed reality, simulations, and computer modeling technologies. Through this initiative, students and teachers working in schools in West Virginia and Delaware will gain access to innovative, interactive tools that empower students to become informed environmental stewards and engaged learners in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the impact of spatial computing technologies on student learning outcomes, engagement, and interest in E-STEM careers. Research questions compare the proven curriculum (control) with the enhanced spatial computing curriculum (experimental) and evaluate the impact of local partnerships and selectable mixed reality avatars on student interest in E-STEM careers.  Using a quasi-experimental design, researchers will explore how interactive instructional technologies and career avatars enhance elementary school students' comprehension of environmental science content and foster interest in E-STEM careers. Mixed methods, including pre/post-assessments, focus groups, and spatial computing platform analytics, will evaluate the project's effectiveness. Planned deliverables include an updated \"Shared Waters\" curriculum, professional development modules for teachers that enable them to implement the curriculum, and web-based dissemination of curriculum resources. By providing a scalable model for integrating spatial computing into elementary grade-level environmental education, this project contributes to educational excellence and workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
