 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, is focused on creating new materials by stacking ultra-thin layers of different elements. When these layers are combined in just the right way, they can show surprising behaviors, such as conducting electricity in unusual ways or reacting to magnets in ways we do not see in everyday materials. By carefully growing these materials into high-quality crystals, the principal investigator and her research group at Baylor University explore how the arrangement of layers leads to these unexpected effects. The goal is to better understand how the structure of a material impacts what it can do. Using advanced tools and techniques, this research could lead to the discovery of new materials that power future technologies like quantum computers and next-generation electronics. In addition, this project provides opportunities for student training in multi-disciplinary research and enables science-themed outreach in partnership with the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired.\r\n\r\nPART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nWith this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, researchers at Baylor University investigate the growth and characterization of high-quality single crystals of rare earth layered antimonides and tellurides, materials that offer fertile ground for discovering emergent physical phenomena. Comprising intergrown, structurally distinct subunits, these compounds provide a platform for probing correlated electron behavior, topological phases, and exotic magnetic orders. The significance of this work lies in its potential to uncover higher-order emergent properties, complex behaviors that arise from the interplay of multiple quantum phenomena and cannot be predicted from the properties of individual components alone. By leveraging recently discovered structure types within a tunable system, this study advances critical insights into how structural intergrowth drives the formation of novel quantum states. The research integrates thermal analysis, in situ experimentation, bulk crystal growth, and systematic investigations of electronic and magnetic properties in single crystals. Through the strategic selection of structural systems and the application of advanced methodologies, this work establishes a foundational framework for the development of heterostructure-inspired two-dimensional materials. The anticipated outcomes will significantly advance the understanding of emergent quantum phenomena and contribute to the design of next-generation functional materials with potential applications in quantum information science, spintronics, and other transformative technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
