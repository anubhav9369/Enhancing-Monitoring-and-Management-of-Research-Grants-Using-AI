 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a technology to deliver wireless power and data through the ground. Present-day wireless power and communication techniques perform poorly underground, making the deployment of electronic devices at depth challenging. The technology supports underground sensing, which is essential for industries such as geothermal energy and mining, and plays a key role in expanding access to electricity. In addition, the technology could help bring electricity to more places and make the energy system more secure by lowering the cost of building and maintaining power equipment. This new approach connects ideas from both electrical engineering and geophysics.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an innovative approach to transmitting wireless power and data through the ground. The core innovation diverges from contemporary long-range wireless power solutions that rely on electromagnetic space-wave techniques through the air. This project is expected to advance the underground wireless transmission field, providing a robust solution for subsurface characterization and potential uses in a number of other applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
