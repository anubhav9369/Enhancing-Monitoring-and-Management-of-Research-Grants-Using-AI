 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ExLENT Explorations Tack project aims to serve the national interest by launching a workforce development initiative to expand access to high skilled careers in semiconductors and advanced manufacturing. Led by Stony Brook University (SBU) in collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), SUNY community colleges, and industry partners, the initiative addresses the critical national need for a technically prepared workforce. It focuses on learners from non-STEM backgrounds, with a goal of serving up to 75 participants. Through immersive training in worldclass clean room nanofabrication facilities and direct connections to established hiring pathways in industry and national laboratories, participants gain practical skills and clear entry points into the field. Importantly, the project supports U.S. technological and economic leadership by strengthening the domestic workforce in advanced manufacturing and other strategic emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s primary goal centers on ensuring participants gain and retain essential and preferred job-specific qualifications required for technician and engineering roles in areas such as mechatronics, maintenance, and chemical and material synthesis. These qualifications include experience working in cleanroom environments while using the appropriate garments and equipment and demonstrated ability to operate in ways that uphold Environmental, Health, Safety & Security (EHS) requirements. To achieve this goal the project offers two structured tracks: 1) Explorer, with three-month traineeships and 2) Developer, with one-year traineeships, each combining technical training and professional development to support career readiness. Participants build technical and professional competencies through hands-on work at BNL\u2019s Center for Functional Nanomaterials, guided mentorship, career coaching through the SBU Career Center, and engagement with industry partners. The project leverages a strategic cross-sector partnership governed by an advisory board that ensures broad stakeholder representation and continuous project improvement. Evaluation and assessment efforts generate new evidence on which strategies most effectively support skill acquisition and long-term competency retention in STEM careers. In particular, the project produces actionable insights, metrics, and guidance on the effectiveness of mentor training and cohort-based engagement. Findings are shared with advisory committee members, presented at national conferences, and developed into research publications on experiential learning models for semiconductor workforce development. This effort advances an innovative, collaborative model for preparing the next generation of STEM professionals and offers a scalable approach for other regions across the country. The NSF ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and their access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
