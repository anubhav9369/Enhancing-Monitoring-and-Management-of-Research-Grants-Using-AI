 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Ignite Innovation Ecosystem Programs Technical Assistance and Support project seeks to provide a tiered approach of ongoing support and technical assistance for applicant regions that pursued federal, innovation-focused place-based economic development grant programs but did not ultimately receive funding due to limited availability of funds. The intent is to sustain the significant momentum generated by progress made in pursuit of these competitive programs, helping sustain regional economic development strategies, develop alternative approaches to sustainability, and ultimately enhancing regional innovation ecosystems across the country. U.S. Ignite\u2019s approach will focus on fostering regional economic develop through the deployment of online resources, enhance collaboration between regional stakeholders, expand access to funding and investment, and help drive the translation of emerging technology research into regional economic competitive advantage. The project includes a plan to provide foundational support for up to 200 regional applicants, with more targeted investment for up to 15-20 selected communities. \r\n\r\nThis work builds upon the significant economic development and technology acceleration momentum generated by various federal place-based innovation ecosystem investment programs, notably including the NSF Regional Innovation Engines program. By designing a structured, multi-tier support system for delivering technical assistance, supports, and guidance to regions, this award can help sustain the positive economic and technological impacts generated by these place-based programs, even without a large implementation award being made to the region. Over the course of three years, this project will support up to 200 regions with a baseline level of support while tracking the impact that this support has on regional success and advancements to the technical state of practice focused on by a particular regional coalition.\r\n\r\nThe activities supported by this award have a significant chance to advance national priorities, bolster regional economic growth, and advance technological progress. This award\u2019s activities are led by U.S. Ignite, a non-profit organization has extensive experience working closely with communities, startups, and researchers to solve tough economic development and technology innovation challenges.  This project\u2019s support plan will have a national scope, providing regions with direct access to resources, expert guidance, and strategic recommendations. Activities will also include the development of broadly applicable playbooks on industrial cluster expansion, startup acceleration and formation, and funding strategies. In its initial year, U.S. ignite will work to launch the effort and assess regional and technical strengths among its cohort. In years two and three, U.S. Ignite will deploy deeper levels of supports including playbooks, online tools, annual convenings, and in-depth technical assistance for a smaller cohort of communities. The award includes funding for a robust evaluation program, to better inform how technical assistance efforts for ecosystem support in the future can be tailored and refined \u2013 this has the potential to inform science investment policy and to make significant intellectual contributions to a growing field of practice.  \r\n\r\nInvestment in this project is both consistent and well-aligned with the goals and broad strategic objectives of NSF TIP. This investment is consistent with agency\u2019s goals and the scientific and technological community\u2019s interest in understanding how to further expand the regional impact of its place-based investments and, consequently, drive positive economic outcomes for all Americans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
