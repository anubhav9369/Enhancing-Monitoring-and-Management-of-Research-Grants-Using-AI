 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a portable, non-invasive wound treatment technology that addresses the national need for more effective infection control and wound healing solutions. Chronic wounds, trauma wounds, and burns affect tens of millions annually in the United States alone, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars and contributing to widespread disability, lost productivity, and reduced quality of life. Existing treatments often fall short due to high costs, infrastructure requirements, or inefficacy against drug-resistant infections. The technology represents a compact, reusable device that uses only electricity to rapidly sterilize wounds and stimulate healing. It's accessibility and ease of use make the technology viable in hospitals and military field operations. By improving clinical outcomes while lowering healthcare expenditures and improving quality of life, this innovation supports national priorities in health, welfare, and defense readiness.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a wearable medical device that employs electrical surface barrier discharge to generate low-temperature plasma from ambient air. Plasma, the fourth state of matter and an ionized gas, produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which eradicate a wide range of pathogens \u2014 including antibiotic-resistant bacteria \u2014 and promote tissue regeneration. The device is powered by a battery-operated circuit and incorporates safety features to prevent electrical hazards. Early-stage laboratory studies demonstrate effective pathogen inactivation and safe application on mammalian cells. This innovation is unique because it combines the capabilities of controlling infections and accelerating wound healing while reducing the labor burden on healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
