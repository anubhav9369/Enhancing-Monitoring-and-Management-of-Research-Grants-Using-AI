 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a critical need in the U.S. biomanufacturing industry sector by developing flexible, modular technologies that integrate microbial conversion and chemical upgrading within a single reactor system. Such an integration is essential for producing high-performance chemicals and fuels from biobased intermediates in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The research team will design and demonstrate a novel reactor platform that supports continuous operation, efficient separation, and process intensification, which are key attributes for enabling distributed biomanufacturing. The project will also contribute to the training of students and early-career researchers in interdisciplinary areas spanning precision fermentation, biosensing, electrochemistry, and reactor engineering, thereby strengthening the future workforce in the bioeconomy.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a bio-electrocatalytic Taylor vortex reactor (BETR) system for the integrated production of 3-methylanisole (3-MA) and its upgrading into methylcyclohexane (MCH), a high-energy-density hydrocarbon. This integrated process combines microbial fermentation and electrochemical hydrogenation within a single intensified reactor platform. The team will use high-throughput microbial phenotyping, genetically encoded biosensors, and Bayesian machine learning to identify and optimize yeast strains capable of efficiently producing 3-MA from sugar-based feedstocks. A flexible microbial chassis will be engineered to enhance metabolic flux toward the desired aromatic intermediate while maintaining selectivity and robustness under aerobic fermentation conditions. In parallel, a broad library of electrocatalysts and electrolyte formulations will be screened to develop an experimental\u2013computational framework for catalyst discovery and to establish optimal conditions for the selective hydrogenation of 3-MA to MCH. Electrocatalyst performance will be evaluated based on activity, selectivity, Faradaic efficiency, and stability under mild aqueous conditions that are compatible with upstream bioproduction. The BETR platform, leveraging Taylor\u2013Couette flow, provides enhanced mass transfer and phase mixing that facilitate the co-location of microbial and electrochemical processes. The reactor will be engineered to support in situ product extraction to address potential toxicity issues and minimize downstream separation burdens. To guide system-level optimization and ensure economic viability, the team will use integrated machine learning models to inform technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). These tools will help identify key cost drivers, process bottlenecks, and design trade-offs early in development, supporting iterative improvements across biological, electrochemical, and reactor components. The final goal is to deliver innovative technologies and a functional, small-footprint reactor prototype that can be deployed in distributed biomanufacturing networks. Beyond the immediate application to MCH production, the approach is expected to provide generalizable insights into hybrid bio-electrocatalytic systems and enable new intensification strategies for converting sugars into high-performance products. The research outcomes will contribute foundational knowledge and technology for advancing the next generation of integrated biomanufacturing platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
