 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Carolina (USC) hosted Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is focused on Quantum Computing Workforce Development in the New Era of Computing. This interdisciplinary program brings together eleven faculty from Computer Science and Mathematics across two USC colleges, in collaboration with SC Quantum, NASA Ames, and the Boyd Innovation Center. Each summer, eight students from across the U.S.\u2014primarily rising sophomores and juniors from non-PhD-granting institutions\u2014will engage in a nine-week research experience spanning twelve quantum computing projects. These projects include topics such as quantum machine learning, quantum software testing, quantum protocols, and compiler optimization using AI. Quantum information science (QIS), due to its many novel features, is currently underserved in most undergraduate institutions in the U.S. Helping to build an adequate cohort of researchers and practitioners who understand and use this new paradigm\u2014the main goal of this project\u2014is critically important to the scientific and technological infrastructure of the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe REU Quantum Computing Workforce Development in the New Era of Computing will attract students with interests in theoretical computer science, mathematics, physics, or engineering. Alongside their research, students will engage in enrichment activities\u2014such as hands-on workshops and presentations\u2014that build their skills in quantum computing, communication, professional development, and entrepreneurship. These activities will draw upon the expertise of faculty mentors and industry partners like SC Quantum. Social and networking events will foster community among students, mentors, and professionals. Preparatory materials will be provided before the summer begins, and students will be mentored by both faculty and graduate students throughout the program. The effectiveness of the REU will be evaluated through surveys administered to both students and mentors, with feedback used to improve the program. Long-term outcomes\u2014such as student publications, presentations, and academic placements\u2014will be tracked through social and professional networking platforms.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education & Centers (ENG/EEC), the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ENG/ECCS), and the Division of Physics (MPS/PHY).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
