 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance practice in informal science education with a scalable and adaptable model for community-based, co-design of a future STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) Center. With a collaborative approach, the project aims to ensure that the design of the Center prioritizes fostering skills, knowledge, and interests that align with projected economic growth areas, which is needed to cultivate a well-equipped future STEM workforce. Kidzeum, Loyola University Chicago, and Northwestern University will forge partnerships with regional stakeholders: rural and urban schools, nonprofits serving children, and local STEM professionals from healthcare, agriculture, and skilled trades. These partnerships will intentionally involve community members who will contribute directly to the design of the STEAM Center, its exhibits and activities.  \r\n\r\nProject research will support the development of a new model for engaging small, rural communities that surround an urban core in a manner that fosters a connected learning ecosystem. The methodology guiding this partnership is centered on collaboration and co-design, directly involving community organizations from the very beginning through all stages of partnership development and planning. To gather data directly from the community, the partnership will conduct a series of surveys, focus groups, and use techniques such as asset mapping and Photovoice, to identify strengths across the community and link these strengths to the design of the STEAM Center. The project model will be shared widely with the field through publications and conference presentations.\r\n\r\nThis Partnership project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
