 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of an innovative educational game designed to simulate supply chain dynamics to provide an interactive learning experience for students and professionals. This game models different segments of a supply chain to help players gain hands-on experience with real-world decision-making. Unlike traditional lecture- and case-based teaching methods, this innovative tool provides a more engaging way to improve students' understanding of supply chain techniques while also broadening public awareness of supply chain concepts. The potential impact of this game can be extended for workforce training in industries where supply chain management plays a critical role. With supply chain disruptions increasingly affecting businesses and economies, the adoption of interactive learning tools like this game can help build a more skilled and adaptable workforce to support national interests in economic stability and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a patented educational board game that replicates key supply chain processes, such as material supply, manufacturing, distribution, and sales, through structured gameplay. The game incorporates supply chain decisions such as demand forecasting, supplier selection, inventory management, logistics trade-offs, and risk assessment, to provide a simulated yet practical experience of supply chain operations. The game is refined and its effectiveness improved by incorporating user feedback from students, educators, and industry professionals. A web-based version is also in development to expand accessibility. By combining game-based learning with digital technology, this solution advances educational methodologies and provides an innovative tool for training the next generation of supply chain professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
