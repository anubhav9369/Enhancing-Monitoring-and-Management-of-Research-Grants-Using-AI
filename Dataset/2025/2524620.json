 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building skills in computer science is significant for meeting our nation\u2019s goals in developing a highly skilled and technology savvy workforce. In the U.S. Four Corners region, which encompasses parts of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, access to foundational computer science education and professional development for teachers is extremely limited. This CSforAll Research Practice Partnership between Northern Arizona University, the non-profit Computer Science Alliance, and multiple school districts across the Four Corners region aims to improve K-12 computer science pathways. By building teacher-led leadership circles, this project will address the ways in which connecting community, context, and coding in computer science education will increase the quantity and quality of learning experiences, interest, and achievement in computer science in the Four Corners Region.\r\n\r\nThis CSforAll Pathways project aims to achieve greater interest, participation, recruitment, and retention of middle and high school students in the Four Corners region of the US by building a network of teacher-led Leadership Circles that are connected (forming a constellation) to meet its objectives. The circles will 1) build CS capacity among K6-12 teachers, 2) develop and share effective after-school programs, 3) collaborate with the local community, colleges, and organizations, and 4) embed industry and research projects in the curriculum design. The three dimensions specified within the constellation model involve collaborations with local stakeholders and authorities. The project will conduct iterative design-based research and will build communities of practice that include representatives from school district administrators, researchers, and community members. The project aims to increase the availability of computer science and make it meaningful for teachers and students. Both student and teacher perspectives will be gauged using mixed methods approaches including surveys, curriculum-embedded assessments, work samples, focus groups, and competence assessments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
