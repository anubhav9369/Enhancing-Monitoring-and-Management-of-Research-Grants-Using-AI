 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance STEM research and education by integrating a 3D motion analysis system into the research and curriculum of three colleges at Des Moines University. The system will allow researchers to discover new ways to help persons with injuries or disabilities and improve movement performance of all people. In addition, the motion capture system will enhance high school and college outreach programs. Training will be developed to prepare the next generation of scientists to engage with advanced computer models of human motion and function. Students will have the opportunity to interact with motion capture tools supported by faculty who will engage students in motion analysis research. This project will provide interactive experiences using cutting-edge 3D motion capture and analysis technology to improve their understanding of how the body moves, including the effects of abnormal or altered movement. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this interdisciplinary project are to: 1. Expand movement science research related to motion analysis, biomechanics, biomechanical data analysis, and musculoskeletal modeling; 2. Train the next generation of health science and medical professionals in applications of STEM including biomechanical concepts and technology used to study human movement and function; and 3. Integrate hands-on learning experiences into curricula that enriches student understanding of biomechanical principles, technology, and computer science related to analysis and study of human movement and function. The project team will train a future workforce prepared by experiences with 3D motion capture to enhance the study of human movement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
