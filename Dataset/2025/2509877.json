 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) award supports the acquisition of an advanced thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) instrument, the NanoFrazor (NF) Explore, by the University of Mississippi (UM). The NF Explore uses a unique lithography method that directly creates micro- and nano-scale structures and patterns by precisely heating a material sensitive to temperature changes, eliminating the need for photomasks used in traditional methods such as photolithography and electron-beam lithography. This acquisition will significantly enhance multidisciplinary research capabilities at UM and for collaborating institutions across the Mid-South region, including Mississippi State University, Jackson State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi. Researchers in fields spanning chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering will benefit from this state-of-the-art technology. Currently, Mississippi lacks a dedicated nanofabrication facility, making this instrument essential for introducing nanofabrication capabilities to the state. Furthermore, this acquisition will offer invaluable hands-on training for undergraduate and graduate students, advancing their research and educational experience. The project will also include educational outreach activities aimed at promoting nanotechnology and nanoscience awareness among K-12 students and the broader public.\r\n\r\nThe NanoFrazor (NF) Explore, a cutting-edge thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) system, utilizes localized heating of a thermally sensitive resist to achieve nanoscale patterning and imaging, setting it apart from traditional methods such as photolithography and electron-beam lithography. This acquisition will significantly enhance multidisciplinary research at the UM and neighboring institutions throughout the Mid-South region in fields including chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering. Specifically, NF Explore\u2019s capabilities - high-resolution patterning, precise nanoscale heat application, and broad substrate versatility - will initially support innovation across eighteen research groups and one research center focused on a) micro/nanofluidics and micro/nanoelectrode systems; b) engineering devices; c) functional materials and arrays; and d) substrates for chemical and biological characterization. By providing precise nanopatterning with minimal substrate damage and exceptional overlay accuracy without the need for alignment markers, this system will facilitate advancements in nanophotonic devices, high-frequency acoustic metamaterials, advanced heat transfer technologies, and chem/bio sensors. Furthermore, the acquisition will promote extensive training and outreach activities, directly contributing to workforce development in advanced manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication in Mississippi. Ultimately, the NF Explore will catalyze collaborative, pioneering research, drive substantial scholarly output, and significantly bolster regional nanofabrication infrastructure, positioning UM and Mississippi as a leading hub for nanoscale science and engineering innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
