 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a non-invasive imaging solution designed to improve how therapeutic cells are evaluated in biomedical research. Cell therapies are becoming a critical tool in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, but current evaluation methods are slow, costly, rely on invasive tissue sampling, and provide only static snapshots of dynamic biological processes. This solution addresses these limitations by enabling researchers to visualize and quantify the behavior of therapeutic cells inside the body over time. This advancement holds promise for reducing preclinical development timelines, lowering research costs, and improving the quality of early decision-making in therapy development. By making cell therapy research more efficient and dynamic, the project supports the national interest by promoting scientific progress, advancing public health, and strengthening innovation in the life sciences sector.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a radiolabeling platform that enables direct, quantitative imaging of living therapeutic cells using positron-based medical imaging. The platform involves chemical oxidation of cell surface sugar residues, site-specific conjugation of a modified metal-binding agent, and stable incorporation of a positron-emitting isotope. The resulting labeled cells maintain viability and function, allowing for high-resolution, whole-body tracking. Unlike conventional methods that require invasive procedures and large cohorts, this technology allows for longitudinal assessment in the same subject, reducing variability and increasing data quality. By enabling early, real-time insights into the distribution and persistence of therapeutic cells, the platform supports more informed preclinical evaluations and faster translation of cell-based therapies from laboratory research to clinical application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
