 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has created a significant demand for a skilled workforce capable of managing, designing, and securing IoT systems. This project, Empowering Digital Growth and Education in Internet of Things (IOT EDGE) at Central New Mexico Community College (CNM), aims to address this workforce need by developing a comprehensive, for-credit IoT program tailored to meet industry demands and increase participation in STEM fields. Over the three-year duration of the project, CNM will recruit and train students to prepare them for high-demand careers in IoT. The program will provide students with opportunities to earn industry-recognized credentials and an associate degree while gaining hands-on experience through internships and capstone projects with industry partners. Faculty will receive professional development and opportunities to enhance classroom instruction with real-world IoT applications. By fostering industry collaboration, updating curriculum content, and implementing high-impact educational practices, this project seeks to make meaningful contributions to workforce readiness in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project's goals include developing an industry-aligned IoT curriculum, deepening opportunities for participation throughout CNM, and integrating experiential learning opportunities to enhance student engagement and career preparation. The program will include stackable credentials, robust industry partnerships, and faculty professional development to ensure alignment with workforce needs. Students will take a series of courses covering IoT fundamentals, networking, and industrial applications, culminating in a capstone project in collaboration with industry mentors. Faculty will benefit from professional development workshops and industry collaborations to incorporate current IoT trends and practices into the curriculum. An advisory council, comprising representatives from industry and academia, will provide ongoing feedback and guidance to ensure program relevance and effectiveness. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
