 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) is the preeminent international gathering of mathematicians in the world. Organized by the International Mathematical Union, an organization with 87 adhering member nations, including the United States, the ICM serves as a global forum for mathematicians to present and learn about new mathematical developments, directions of future research, applications, ideas for pedagogy, and methodologies for disseminating and archiving mathematical knowledge. In 2026, the ICM will be held in Philadelphia, PA, on July 23 \u2013 30, with an anticipated 5,000 individuals from around the world attending. With support from this grant the American Mathematical Society will advertise and execute a program to provide travel grants for approximately 140 US-based mathematicians. The Society has administered similar travel grant programs for previous ICM gatherings, beginning with ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan. The participation of a robust contingent of US-based mathematicians in these events helps to sustain the US\u2019s world leadership position in mathematical research and contributes directly to the US\u2019s knowledge infrastructure, national security, industry, and commerce. Students and researchers supported by this grants program will have rich opportunities to learn from and interact with researchers from around the world and share their discoveries and insights.\r\n\r\nThe 2026 ICM Structure Committee has set the following twenty topical sections for the Congress: Logic; Algebra; Number Theory; Algebraic and Complex Geometry; Geometry; Topology; Lie Theory and Generalizations; Analysis; Dynamics; Partial Differential Equations; Mathematical Physics; Probability; Combinatorics; Mathematics of Computer Science; Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing; Control Theory and Optimization; Statistics, Machine Learning, Image and Signal Processing; Stochastic and Differential Modeling; Mathematical Education and Popularization of Mathematics; and History of Mathematics. Through plenary invited lectures, special sessions, and other activities, the opportunities for participants to exchange ideas in these sections are plentiful. The 2026 ICM will incorporate the most prestigious awards and lectures in the mathematical sciences: the Fields Medal, Abacus Medal, Gauss Prize, Chern Medal Award, the Emmy Noether Lecture, and Leelavati Prize.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
