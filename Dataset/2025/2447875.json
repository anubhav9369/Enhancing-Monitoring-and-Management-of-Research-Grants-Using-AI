 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site program at Texas Tech University focuses on advancing knowledge and workforce development in the field of wide and ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor technologies. The project addresses critical needs in high-speed electronics, power systems, and photonics, supporting national priorities such as technological innovation, energy efficiency, and national security. By engaging undergraduate students in cutting-edge research and hands-on training, the program aims to prepare a highly skilled workforce capable of contributing to the innovations that underpin modern communications, military systems, and industry. Participants will also develop essential technical and soft skills through seminars, mentorship, and professional development activities, fostering interest in advanced research and graduate studies in electrical and computer engineering. Overall, this initiative promotes scientific progress, and educational excellence with broad benefits for society and the economy.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a research and training environment focused on the synthesis, characterization, and application of wide and ultrawide bandgap semiconductor materials, particularly for nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. The research aims to address fundamental challenges in the growth, fabrication, and integration of high-quality UWBG semiconductors such as Ga2O3 and related heterostructures. The program's core activities include epitaxial growth, device fabrication, and characterization of high-power transistors, light-emitting devices, and memory components. The methodology combines theoretical modeling, materials synthesis, and advanced testing techniques, with an emphasis on translating research into emerging applications like high-power electronics, RF devices, and optical emitters. The project will contribute to the scientific understanding of UWBG materials and accelerate their deployment in next-generation technologies, supporting the U.S. semiconductor industry and national security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
