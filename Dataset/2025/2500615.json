 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advanced manufacturing sector is experiencing significant growth, driven by technological advancements and the shift toward Industry 4.0. According to the 2024 Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute Talent Study, new workforce needs in manufacturing could be around 3.8 million between 2024 and 2033 nationwide. Competency-Based Education\u2019s (CBE) emphasis on competency rather than time spent in class allows students to acquire skills faster, addressing the workforce shortage more efficiently. The goal of this project is to develop and implement innovative CBE pathways in advanced manufacturing at Northeast Iowa Community College (NICC), located in Northeast Iowa, to address workforce gaps. By emphasizing credit for prior learning (CPL) and adaptable instructional approaches, the project will support rural learners facing geographic barriers and veterans transitioning to civilian careers.\r\n\r\nThe CBE curricula will be introduced for three degree programs and one diploma program, offering flexible learning tailored to the needs and schedules of community college students. The project includes recruitment strategies, new articulation agreements with four-year institutions, and strengthened industry partnerships supporting internships and apprenticeships. Micro-credentials co-developed with industry and non-credit career pathway certificates will serve as recruitment tools, focused on stronger engagement with rural and veteran communities. A comprehensive evaluation plan will assess the effectiveness of CBE as both a learning strategy and institutional asset, with findings disseminated through educational networks. Industry-aligned curricula and recruitment tools will be developed, and a flexible learning lab will be expanded to support the CBE model. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
