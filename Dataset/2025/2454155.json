 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro- and nano-technology (MNT) industries are growing and evolving at an ever-increasing pace, especially in the microelectronics sector. A major component of the MNT skilled technical workforce (STW) is the semiconductor microelectronics industry; however the disciplinary areas of Materials Science, Physics, Chemistry, and other majors also contribute to MNT industry jobs. A highly skilled workforce will be essential to meet the challenges of revitalizing the U.S. MNT industry and building resiliency into the MNT workforce supply chain. That workforce must meet short- term labor demands as new semiconductor manufacturing, advanced packaging, and nanobiotechnology facilities are built, as well as sustain the long-term growth of the domestic industry. New talent will be required to build, equip, and run MNT manufacturing and packaging facilities, design advanced products, and advance research and development. The Micro- and Nano-Technology Education Center (MNT-EC) will leverage lessons learned to develop a streamlined nationalized approach to MNT education. Working together with the MNT community and industry leaders, MNT-EC will support the development of programs in partnership with industry to meet the current and future needs of the MNT STW.\r\n \r\nThe Center will: 1) work to support all students entering the MNT career pathway in earning degrees and employment within MNT industries; 2) provide 2-year faculty with professional development opportunities and mentoring to both enhance current programs and support the development of new programs;  and 3) convene and coordinate between current academic programs in developing and sharing educational materials that address industry needs. The MNT-EC will partner with industry to educate and train a competent MNT technician workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
