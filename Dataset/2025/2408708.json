 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Infrastructure (MRI) grant acquire an advanced metal additive manufacturing (AM) system that will support research to advance knowledge in metal AM, contributing to scientific progress and enhancing national economic prosperity. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, enables the creation of complex components that are difficult or impossible to produce through traditional methods. The acquired equipment will enhance the structural performance of AM parts, develop sustainable energy solutions, and improve engineering education through hands-on experiences with advanced technologies. These advancements will benefit society by fostering innovation, sustainability, and workforce development in critical industries such as aerospace, energy, and healthcare. The interdisciplinary nature of this research, which involves fields like manufacturing, materials science, and sustainable engineering, will also support the education and training in engineering and STEM.\r\n\r\nThe technical research facilitated by the advanced metal AM system will address several critical areas, significantly advancing knowledge in AM. The system will enable the development of advanced qualification and certification methods to enhance the reliability and structural integrity of AM components. Efforts will focus on developing novel post-processing strategies to improve fatigue resistance. Performance-based topology optimization for intricate geometries will be conducted to enhance robustness under extreme conditions, including fluid-structure interactions. Furthermore, innovations will include supersonic fluid mixing systems, high-efficiency heat exchangers, advancements in photovoltaic cells, and catalyst bed optimization for water purification reactors. Through innovative research, education, and training programs, this project will contribute to both fundamental knowledge and practical applications, driving impact in sustainable energy, workforce development, and the competitiveness of U.S. industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
