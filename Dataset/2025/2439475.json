 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to generate new evidence-based practices for using virtual reality (VR) to teach complex, invisible physics concepts (for example, wind flow and force). VR is a promising technology to improve conceptual understanding of invisible physics, as VR can provide visualizable, interactive learning opportunities. The practices generated from this Level 2 Engaged Student Learning project are intended to provide instructors and administrators in STEM education with a concrete guide on when, why, and how to use VR to effectively teach invisible physics. Accordingly, this project plans to significantly improve student learning of invisible physics and, more generally, advance understanding of principles of how humans learn in VR environments. This project is positioned to help shape the careers of both undergraduate and graduate students who work on this research project in a multidisciplinary setting. The research training planned for the project\u2019s student personnel is designed to inspire future engineering educators to teach undergraduate courses using VR. It also aims to develop computer science professionals who can enhance VR learning systems and learning scientists who will advance fundamental research on how we learn in virtual environments.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project involves (a) advancing scientific models of human learning in VR environments, (b) providing reliable, systematic evidence on the effectiveness of VR-aided undergraduate engineering education, and (c) generating new evidence-based best practice of VR applications to complement traditional teaching pedagogy.  Cognitive science research predicts that some features of VR, such as enabling learners to explore causal relationships, will enhance learning, while other features might harm learning.  There have been few rigorous, systematic investigations into the specific features of VR interactions that improve or impair learning. This project plans to use rigorous experiments to generate new knowledge on the promise and perils of VR in aiding teaching invisible physics concepts compared to high-quality traditional teaching. A workshop for undergraduate instructors is proposed to deliver best practices and provide a concrete, actionable guide on why, when, and how to use VR. Plans also include dissemination to broad audiences through seminars, conferences, workshops, and a project website. A planned external advisory board comprises domain experts for conducting formative and summative evaluation of the project. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the project supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
