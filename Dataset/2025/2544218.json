 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of shelf-stable, ready-to-use 3D bioprinted tissue models for preclinical drug development. Current in vitro models, such as 2D cultures, spheroids, and organoids, are useful in certain contexts but the structural and cellular complexity need to more accurately replicate human physiology. As a result, the printed tissue models often fail to predict clinical outcomes, contributing to high drug attrition rates. Regulatory trends increasingly favor alternatives to animal models, highlighting the urgent need for advanced, human-relevant in vitro systems. While 3D bioprinting offers a path forward, its impact has been limited by the inability to store, manufacture centrally, and distribute models. Cryobioprinted tissues address these challenges by enabling long-term storage and on-demand use. This advancement improves accessibility, reproducibility, and scalability for applications such as drug screening, toxicity testing, and disease modeling.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on cryobioprinting, a method that combines 3D bioprinting with integrated cryopreservation during biofabrication. The resulting constructs can be frozen, stored, shipped, and thawed while maintaining structural integrity and biological function. The platform supports diverse cell types and applications, including personalized medicine. In addition to supporting drug development workflows, the technology improves efficiency, accelerates timelines, and aims to enhance predictive accuracy while reducing overall drug development costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
