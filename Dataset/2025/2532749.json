 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nEarly growth of the semiconductor industry was largely driven by understanding and controlling defects in materials. The progress of modern quantum and microelectronic technologies warrant similar understanding for new types of materials. This project aims to study the role of defects in CuCrO2, a semiconductor which has potential for transparent electronics and is a special type of magnetic material, called a multiferroic, which is highly sought for switching and storage applications. The project involves synthesizing high quality films of this material, imparting controllable defects and understanding how such defects affect its properties.  It also trains students in experimental methods that are relevant for industrial material processing and cutting-edge research. The project expands knowledge on the role of defects in materials, creates opportunities for student research, contributes to workforce development, and broadens the horizon of material processing for microelectronic and quantum technologies. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nDefects can readily perturb the long-range electronic behavior of materials, and understanding their role is critical to discern whether material properties are intrinsic or due to these extrinsic perturbations. This project seeks to understand the role of defects in CuCrO2, a transparent semiconductor and a multiferroic material, with potential application in electronic applications. Controlled defects are introduced through ion irradiation and quantified using ion scattering, diffraction and electron microscopy. The electronic and magnetic behavior of this material is studied using spectroscopy, electronic transport and magnetometry. The insights obtained from this project expands the understanding of how defects affect the behavior of quantum materials and provides avenues to create properties on demand. The project expands knowledge on the role of defects in materials, creates opportunities for student research, contributes to workforce development, and broadens the horizon of material processing for microelectronic and quantum technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
