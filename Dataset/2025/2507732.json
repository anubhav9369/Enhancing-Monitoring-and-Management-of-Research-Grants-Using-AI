 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to significantly improve the performance, cost, and durability of energy storage systems, which are critical to enabling the widespread adoption of renewable energy. Current long-duration energy storage technologies, such as redox flow batteries, are limited by high operating costs and performance degradation. This project aims to address these issues by developing a new type of advanced membrane using a novel porous material that can enable better selectivity, efficiency, and longevity. If successful, this innovation could lower the total cost of ownership for energy storage systems, enabling utilities and grid operators to store renewable electricity for use when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing. The technology is scalable and compatible with continuous manufacturing processes, which supports its eventual commercial deployment. The first market entry point will be long-duration stationary energy storage, with the potential to expand to water treatment and chemical separations. The innovation could enhance U.S. leadership in clean energy technologies, advance grid reliability, and contribute to national efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It represents a durable competitive advantage in an emerging, fast-growing market.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project introduces an innovative manufacturing approach for advanced membranes based on metal-organic frameworks, a class of porous materials known for their tunable structure, high selectivity, and chemical stability. Despite their promise, metal-organic framework membranes have faced major barriers to commercial adoption due to challenges in large-scale fabrication and integration. This project addresses these limitations by developing a continuous, scalable roll-to-roll process for coating porous polymer substrates with metal-organic framework layers. The approach enables uniform, adherent coatings over large areas and is compatible with existing membrane formats, positioning it for industrial relevance. The research will focus on optimizing metal-organic framework substrate compatibility, improving coating uniformity, and ensuring mechanical durability. Performance will be assessed through rigorous characterization and electrochemical testing. The membranes are intended to address critical needs in advanced electrochemical systems that demand precise ion selectivity and long-term stability. One promising application is in non-aqueous redox flow batteries, where membrane performance hinders its commercialization. This work will establish the technical foundation for scale-up and broader adoption in clean energy and other high-impact applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
