 "awd_abstract_narration": "A constant stream of high energy sub-atomic particles enters the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. These particles are known as cosmic rays and originate from the most energetic places in the universe such as star-forming regions or blackholes at the centers of galaxies. The understanding of the dynamics of these places is one of the key issues in high energy astrophysics that can led us to the understanding of mechanisms for extreme energy creation. The study of such objects is enabled by gamma rays; an extremely energetic form of light produced in their environments. The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory operated by the NSF, and built by joint US-Mexico collaboration, is a unique experiment that surveys two-thirds of the sky every day in gamma rays. This award supports scientists at the Michigan State University to use HAWC data to study the physical processes in the most extreme environments in the universe and help answer fundamental questions about the nature of matter. The exciting science capabilities of HAWC are conveyed to the public through engaging talks and interactive displays at local venues. The group has a strong tradition of training scientific workforce and academic leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nPrecision surveys of the most energetic (GeV--PeV) and most distant environments in the universe, will ultimately help answer two distinct but related major questions in modern particle astrophysics: the origin of cosmic rays, and the nature of dark matter. The Michigan State group with its expertise in multi-messenger data analysis, will pursue studies of unidentified potential cosmic-ray accelerators in the galaxy identified by LHAASO, search for gamma-ray flares coincident with neutrinos detected by IceCube, and use machine learning to improve background rejection and source characterization. The methods will also lay the groundwork for the software development and analysis tools for the next generation Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO). Hands-on outreach activities will engage the local community of high school students and public through the MSU science festival and talks at local venues.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
