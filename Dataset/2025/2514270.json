 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the growing demand for high-performance, compact, and energy-efficient wireless systems by advancing Dual Function Radar Communication technology. DFRC systems integrate communication and sensing capabilities into a single platform, reducing hardware redundancy, cost, and power consumption while enhancing spectral efficiency. The research is aimed at next-generation applications \u2014 including autonomous vehicles, satellite and UAV systems, and smart manufacturing \u2014 where both high-speed communication and high-resolution sensing are critical. The project tackles key challenges in these domains, particularly the efficient allocation of spectral resources and the mitigation of Doppler-induced performance degradation in high-mobility environments where traditional systems fall short.\r\n\r\nA novel Dual-Function Radar-Communication system is proposed to support high-mobility scenarios while efficiently utilizing bandwidth for both communication and sensing. The system features a monostatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar that transmits OTFS waveforms. Bandwidth efficiency is achieved by enabling Doppler-delay domain bins to be shared across transmit antennas. A low-complexity approach is introduced to obtain coarse target estimates within the aperture limits of the receive array. This research further leverages a key strength of MIMO radar: achieving spatial resolution beyond the receive array\u2019s aperture through the use of a virtual array. Forming a virtual array requires orthogonal transmit waveforms. However, ensuring such orthogonality \u2014 e.g., through separate, non-overlapping resources for communication and sensing \u2014 typically reduces communication rates. Our system addresses this challenge by enabling virtual array-based high-resolution sensing while minimizing its impact on communication throughput. A central innovation is the introduction of Time-Frequency domain private bins, which enable virtual array construction at a collocated receiver. These bins, combined with a discretization of the target space around the coarse estimates, facilitate the formulation of a sparse signal recovery problem, resulting in significant improvement in target parameter estimation. Although using private bins reduces available Doppler-delay domain resources \u2014 introducing a trade-off between communication rate and sensing accuracy \u2014 only a small number are needed to achieve notable sensing gains with minimal impact on communication performance. The proposed system is implemented on a multi-antenna software-defined radio testbed at Rutgers University\u2019s WINLAB. This prototype will empirically evaluate communication-sensing trade-offs and demonstrate the system\u2019s robustness. The project also offers hands-on research and educational experiences for students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
