 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support US-based researchers to participate the Banff International Research Station - Casa Matem\u00e1tica Oaxaca (BIRS-CMO) Workshop 25w5402: Equivariant Topological Quantum Field Theory will be held from September 7th - 12th at Hotel Hacienda Los Laureles in Oaxaca City, Mexico. The first-of-its-kind event will bring together experts in a relatively small subfield of mathematical physics to concentrate efforts on making meaningful progress on open problems while training a new generation of students and early-career mathematicians to work in the area. The workshop activities are designed with the intention of developing a strong network of researchers in equivariant topological quantum field theory across the Americas.\r\n\r\nTopological quantum field theories (TQFTs) give mathematically rigorous descriptions of systems whose physics is independent of the geometry of spacetime. These theories are playing an increasingly important role in theoretical and mathematical physics, where they model the symmetries of ordinary quantum field theories as well as certain low-energy quantum systems called topological phases of matter which are influential in developing both hardware and software for quantum computers. TQFTs are also an invaluable source of inspiration in pure mathematics, where they provide a bridge between the subjects of algebra and topology. Equivariant TQFTs specifically capture TQFTs with symmetry and thus represent a critical aspect in the study of TQFTs. In spite of the relevance and importance of the topic, the BIRS-CMO Workshop 25w5402 is the first of its kind with a focus entirely on the mathematics of equivariant TQFT. A webpage for the conference website is available at https://www.birs.ca/events/2025/5-day-workshops/25w5402.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
