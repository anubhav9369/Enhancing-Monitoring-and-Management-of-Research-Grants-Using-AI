 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corrosion is a major contributor to structural deterioration in steel structures, leading to increased maintenance costs and reduced reliability. Across the United States, tens of thousands of steel bridges are in poor or fair condition, primarily due to corrosion-related damage. This research project investigates the use of cold spray metal additive manufacturing as a method to restore corroded steel bridge components directly on-site. Unlike traditional repair techniques that require extensive welding, cutting, or complete replacement, cold spray offers the ability to apply new metal onto corroded areas without melting, allowing for localized repairs with minimal surface preparation. Through full-scale testing on real corroded bridge beams, the research will evaluate whether this technique can restore the mechanical properties of damaged steel members to levels suitable for structural use. The approach could minimize waste and lead contamination while enabling targeted repairs using portable, field-deployable equipment. By integrating advanced scanning, quality control, and durability analysis, this work intends to support safer and longer-lasting infrastructure. The work also includes development of inspection protocols to assess repair quality. Additionally, the project provides valuable educational and workforce training opportunities in manufacturing and civil engineering, contributing to the resilience of transportation networks.\r\n\r\nThe research investigates the mechanical feasibility, scalability, and field-deployability of cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) for repairing corroded steel structures. Key objectives include: (1) achieving deposition with mechanical properties comparable to structural-grade steel, (2) validating portable cold spray equipment on full-scale, naturally corroded bridge beams, and (3) integrating lead-removal, waste-capture systems, and a novel durability life analysis into the repair process. The methodology combines extended mechanical testing of composite steel coupons, optimization of cold spray deposition parameters, and development of non-destructive evaluation techniques. Digital workflows will be developed looking to to profile corrosion using 3D scanning and apply targeted repairs. Repaired bridge beams will undergo full-scale mechanical testing to validate restoration of load-carrying capacity. Outcomes look to include validated protocols for field application of CSAM in infrastructure repair, new modeling frameworks for corrosion mitigation, and contributions to the fundamental understanding of solid-state additive repair systems for civil infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
