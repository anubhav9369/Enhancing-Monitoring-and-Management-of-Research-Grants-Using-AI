 "awd_abstract_narration": "Demonstrating practical quantum advantage for problems relevant to science, engineering, and society is a central challenge in quantum information science. To address this challenge, the Open Stack Rydberg Atom Quantum Computing Laboratory (ORAQL) project will combine  next-generation neutral atom logical quantum processing technology and a cross-disciplinary stack. The stack includes a digital twin model, comprising the virtual laboratory component of the project, that will be shared with the community to foster broad national participation in discoveries using ORAQL at the forefront of quantum algorithm development. ORAQL will additionally advance education and workforce development with a specific focus on the neutral atom quantum computing architecture, including digital twin technology as a cutting-edge virtual tool.\r\n\r\nORAQL targets next-generation neutral atom logical quantum processor cores capable of circuit depths of 1-100 megaquops (1 megaquop = million quops or quantum operations) on as many as 400 logical qubits, to be developed within a cross-disciplinary stack consisting of intermediate representation libraries for hardware controls, quantum circuit compilers, tools for quantum error correction (QEC) including decoders, and the ability to explore a broad range of quantum algorithms at the highest level. Included in the cross-disciplinary stack will be a digital twin that accurately models system performance, identifies failure mechanisms, and validates improvements, connecting all levels of the stack from quantum algorithm resource estimation down through the QEC and compilation layers to the quantum processor. Parallel hardware demonstrator efforts target validation of technology drivers: advanced logical qubit performance, fast qubit readout, scalable photonic control, dual-species qubit encoding, and photonic interconnects. Theory efforts will develop new approaches to QEC, improve resource requirements for practical quantum algorithms, decoding and optimize circuit compilation. Education and workforce development efforts include workshops and hackathons, quantum hardware experience kits, and K-12 professional development around ORAQL-specific classroom modules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
