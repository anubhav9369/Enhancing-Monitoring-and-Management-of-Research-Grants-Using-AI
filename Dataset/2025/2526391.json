 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ExLENT Explorations Track project aims to serve the national interest by expanding biotechnology workforce development through experiential learning opportunities for students in rural regions. Led by Utah Tech University, the initiative creates new pathways for students to engage in biotechnology internships, mentorship and applied research experiences that deepen exposure to the field and support long-term STEM success. This initiative establishes a sustainable and replicable biotech micro-hub model designed to strengthen regional opportunities and increase engagement in biotechnology careers. Through a cross-sector partnership between academia and industry, the project integrates mentorship, career coaching, project-based learning, and structured industry experiences to prepare students for workforce entry and long-term success. Importantly, the primary focus is on expanding participation among rural learners, fostering biotechnology entrepreneurship, and embedding students in dynamic, innovation-driven environments. These efforts directly support the national mission for advancing workforce readiness and leadership in emerging technology sectors. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) expand access to experiential learning in applied biotechnology, 2)strengthen the workforce through skill-building and career preparation, 3) establish micro-hub model as a cross-sector approach to workforce development, 4) increase participation of students from rural regions of the country, and 5) track graduates\u2019 entry into the biotechnology workforce or into graduate programs aligned with biotechnology careers. To achieve these goals, the project launches a two-semester, credit-bearing biotechnology capstone designed to mirror real-world startup and R&D environments. Students work in small teams to ideate, develop, and pitch biotech product prototypes, guided by faculty, peer mentors, and industry advisors. Program elements include technical training, career expeditions to biotech hubs, mock interviews, and public research presentations.  The project provides participant stipends and research supplies while tracking post-graduate outcomes.  Faculty engage in site visits to six established biotech hubs to extract best practices and develop a framework for scaling biotech micro-hubs in rural regions. Evaluation and assessment efforts apply a mixed methods approach focusing on key metrics such as participation rates, program engagement, and the strength of peer mentoring relationships. A comprehensive dissemination plan ensures access to project outcomes by faculty, industry partners, education researchers, and other stakeholders. Findings are shared through reports, webinars, conference presentations, and publications. Anticipated outcomes include improved student career identity, increased technical proficiency, regional biotech startup development, and expanded workforce entry for students in rural regions of the country. The NSF ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and their access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
