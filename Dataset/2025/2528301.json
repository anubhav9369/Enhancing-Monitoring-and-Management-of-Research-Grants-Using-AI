 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will be the development of a rapid, portable, and reliable oxidation testing platform for the pet food industry. This innovation addresses a critical gap in on-site quality control, enabling manufacturers and suppliers to assess ingredient freshness, reduce antioxidant overuse, and minimize costly product recalls. The U.S. pet care market is currently valued at over $150 billion, with a projected serviceable obtainable market of $23 million for this specific testing solution. By providing accurate, near real-time oxidation quantification, the new capability will enhance food quality and contribute to improved pet health and longevity. The broader societal benefits include reduced chemical waste, improved supply chain transparency, and stronger consumer trust in pet food products. Furthermore, the platform's core technology, a kinetic fluorogenic assay, has broad applicability across other sectors, including environmental monitoring, point-of-care diagnostics, and defense. These additional use cases position this platform as a potentially transformative analytical tool with significant commercial and societal impact.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a novel kinetic fluorogenic (FG) quantification method that enables selective and rapid measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), a key oxidation biomarker, in under 10 minutes. This approach overcomes major limitations of existing equilibrium-based techniques, which are slow, non-selective, and ill-suited for field use. The research aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this kinetic method through three technical objectives: (1) validating MDA as a reliable biomarker in complex pet food and rendered ingredient samples; (2) developing a user-friendly assay kit for non-expert operators; and (3) constructing a compact, laser-based fluorometric instrument for field deployment. The expected technical outcomes include a functional prototype system that achieves high analytical sensitivity, reliable quantification across diverse sample types, and usability by industry personnel. This work lays the foundation for a new class of field-deployable diagnostic technologies with wide-ranging utility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
