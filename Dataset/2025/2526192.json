 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor manufacturing is increasing across the nation and within the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area.  The automation and precision needed to produce technologically advanced devices such as semiconductor chips require a workforce skilled and adept at maintaining advanced manufacturing equipment, including robots and control systems. In addition to mechanical and electrical aptitude, today\u2019s \u201cfactory worker\u201d (i.e. operator and technician roles) must have a basic understanding of computer logic, troubleshooting techniques, and system-level understanding. This project focuses on upskilling current workers in fields adjacent to the semiconductor industry, creating a pathway for them to enter the highly skilled workforce. Using a combination of different hands-on training, participants will gain skills in microelectronics and advanced manufacturing. This project will serve as the catalyst to expand educational opportunities in these fields by supporting American workers pivoting into semiconductor and advanced manufacturing roles.\r\n\r\nDallas College, along with local education institutions and employer partners, is coming together to create a first-of-its kind model, one that applies the Federation of Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME) earn-and-learn model to continuing education (CE) programming.  The project\u2019s participants will be incumbent unskilled workers, veterans and active-duty military personnel who are seeking new opportunities in microelectronics. Participants will engage in coursework, apprenticeship-style instruction and work-based learning. Upon successful completion, the project has the potential to expand access to CE FAME programs nationwide. Leveraging CE programs as an on-ramp and pathway for adult learners, especially those who never considered college, increases access for all Americans interested in pursuing technical, in-demand, high-wage jobs. \r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
