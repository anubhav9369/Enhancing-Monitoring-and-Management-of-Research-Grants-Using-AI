 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to enable the purchase of new cabinets to house the ornithology specimens, ensure the collection is pest free with cryofumigation, and resequence the specimens in a modern taxonomic order. This award will ensure that critical infrastructure for biological research is secure and accessible, enabling its use now and in the future. In addition, this award will increase knowledge of natural history collections and scientific literacy through a combination of in-person training and activities and virtual engagement. The project will incorporate hands-on opportunities for undergraduate students, volunteers, and staff members. Additionally, the project will feature public engagement through tables showcasing research collections at museum festivals and events, an updated exhibit case visible to all museum visitors highlighting the importance of natural history collections, and virtual resources showcasing the process of de- and re-installation that will engage a broad audience.\r\n\r\nNatural history collections provide an irreplaceable record of current and historic biodiversity. They only become more valuable as technologies progress, facilitating ever increasing possibilities for research and discovery. Protecting and facilitating access to these resources are of utmost importance. The new cabinetry funded here would be a substantial improvement and help ensure that these specimens are preserved for future generations by providing the protection they need from the environment and pests. The new cabinetry with easily opened doors, and trays that fit properly in their cabinets will facilitate their use by staff, students, researchers, and volunteers. Staff time formerly spent mitigating the impacts of these old cabinets can be reallocated toward efforts to grow the collections or make them more accessible for a broad audience, for example, through digitization. Thus, this award will have cascading effects on the current and future use of the collections.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
