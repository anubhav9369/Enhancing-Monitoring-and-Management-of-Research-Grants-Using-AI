 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Salt Lake (GSL) is vital to Utah\u2019s economy, contributing over $1 billion annually through mineral extraction, brine shrimp harvesting, and recreation. However, the lake has reached historically low water levels due to upstream water diversions for agriculture, industry, and municipalities. As the lake shrinks, the newly exposed lakebed is emitting wind-blown dust containing harmful heavy metals like arsenic and lead\u2014byproducts of past industrial activity. This toxic dust threatens public health, agriculture, and ecosystems, with risks that extend far beyond the lake itself. This project will shed light on the role that dust plays in depositing heavy metals into ecosystems and onto important crops including corn and alfalfa. As metals accumulate in plants, they may ascend the food chain into livestock, predators, and ultimately humans, with a variety of negative health outcomes. Therefore, the results of this study will have direct implications for the health of ecosystems and communities both within the Great Basin and around the world.  The results of this research be shared with communities that may be directly impacted by increased dust emission, by leveraging partnerships with local and state agencies and non-profit organizations in outreach through their regular programming such as fact sheets, newsletters, and community presentations. The research will be integrated with education activities by building and distributing soil test kits for students to use within their local communities, and by engaging local K-12 teachers in hands-on research through teacher internships.\r\n\r\nAs the Great Salt Lake continues to shrink and emit more dust, native and agricultural plants may act as vectors of metal contamination, locally and regionally. As such, this study will utilize a combination of greenhouse and field-based sampling and atmospheric modeling to evaluate the risk to humans and ecosystems posed by GSL dust deposited on key native plants and agricultural crops through: 1) Assessing the extent to which plants take up these heavy metals through root and foliar (leaf) uptake, 2)Evaluating differing plant bioaccumulation among taxa key to the Utah economy, 3) Determining the impact of GSL-sourced dust on plants in the Great Basin region, and 4) Identifying potential source regions of dust that are impacting plants.  The project will also analyze strontium, neodymium, and lead isotope ratios in plant tissues to determine the ability of these isotopic signals to determine soil and/or foliar dust compositions or \u201cfingerprints\u201d. Through geochemistry and atmospheric modeling, the research will assess the sources and transport pathways of dust from the GSL lakebed and other regional dust emissions areas and quantify the dust contribution to regional soils. The data generated by this project will contribute to environmental and health-related planning and serve as a new tool for understanding heavy metal (re)distribution during natural processes expedited by environmental change and human activity. These insights are essential for addressing the immediate consequences of the lake\u2019s decline and for predicting more severe impacts in the future, as continued drought and future water management practices could expose more lakebed and increase the risk of toxic dust emissions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
