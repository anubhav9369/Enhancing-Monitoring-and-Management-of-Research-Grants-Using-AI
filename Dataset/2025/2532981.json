 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the MPS-LEAPS (Launching Early-Career Academic Pathways) Program and managed by the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at NSF, Professor Murphy and his students at Tennessee Technological University (TTU) will perform studies that aim to advance the frontiers of organic chemistry through the exploration of furfural as a starting material for novel compounds. A major need in the scientific community is to develop and contribute to new pathways in combating dangerous bacteria as well as microplastic contaminants in the environment. Toward this end, Professor Murphy and his students will synthesize N-acyl hydrazones (NAHs) from furfural, which will be a versatile platform for heterocycle formation, catalysis, and antimicrobial discovery. Their research could deepen the mechanistic understanding of oxidative cyclizations, microplastic degradation, and bioactivity of such NAH compounds. This project will provide students experience in experimental design, modern instrumentation, and problem-solving. \r\n\r\nProfessor Murphy and his students will synthesize NAH compounds and analogs derived from furfural, a biomass-derived chemical feedstock. This project will investigate these NAH compounds for the following aims: i) developing high-yielding, synthetic methods to access NAH and NAH-like compounds, ii) exploring oxidative cyclization reactions to form valuable heterocycles such as oxadiazoles, iii) evaluating NAH derivatives as organocatalysts for depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics, and iv) assessing the antimicrobial properties of these compounds against clinically relevant pathogens. Student researchers will be integral to this research, conducting hands-on synthesis, running analytical experiments, characterizing compounds, and evaluating biological and catalytic activity. This student-lead research could lead to the development of novel antibacterial agents, high-yielding oxidative cyclization strategies for pharmaceutically relevant moieties, and efficient organocatalysts for plastic waste depolymerization. This interdisciplinary approach bridges synthetic organic chemistry and catalysis as well as offers an innovative, flexible scaffold to address scientific challenges while providing students opportunities to gain experience working on impactful research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
