 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, EXPLOR-NEPA: Experiential Learning for AI-Driven Robotics in Northeast Pennsylvania, will expand access to high-quality STEM learning experiences in emerging technology fields. Hosted by Wilkes University in partnership with Production Systems Automation (PSA) and regional high schools, the initiative will address national workforce gaps in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics by equipping students with industry-aligned skills and early exposure to technology-driven careers. The project will offer experiential learning opportunities to high school students in Northeast Pennsylvania, many of whom will have had limited prior access to STEM enrichment. By integrating mentorship, hands-on robotics instruction, and dual enrollment coursework, EXPLOR-NEPA will develop students\u2019 technical competencies and motivation for future careers in AI, automation, and related fields. The project will align with the NSF's mission by advancing the progress of science and engineering while promoting national prosperity and workforce competitiveness. It will offer a scalable and replicable model for experiential STEM education that builds talent pipelines.\r\n\r\nThe project will implement a three-year, tiered engagement structure serving at least 100 high school students across Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton. Students will begin in Robotics Clubs that will provide foundational training in AI, sensors, and embedded systems, and will then advance to dual enrollment in a university-level robotics course and a Scholar Program featuring job shadowing, mentorship, and capstone projects. The program will leverage project-based learning, real-world applications, and industry mentorship to deepen students' conceptual understanding of AI and robotics. Differentiated instructional supports, including peer mentoring, modular curricula, and \"tech-boost\" workshops, will ensure appropriateness for students with varying levels of preparation. Evaluation activities will assess student engagement, skill development, and career persistence. Project outcomes will be disseminated nationally through open-access curricular toolkits, journal publications, and educator networks to inform future workforce development efforts in AI and robotics.\r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
