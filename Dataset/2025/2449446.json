 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) project focuses on how complex data is analyzed, understood, shared, and utilized across critical sectors. The innovation enhances scientific and technological understanding by providing a new open-source ecosystem (OSE), OpenCIVAN (Open-Source Ecosystem for Collaborative and Immersive Visualization and Analytics in a Networked Environment), that enables real-time, immersive visualization and analytics for high-dimensional data through interactive, networked tools. This project addresses the challenge of extracting valuable insights from intricate datasets, offering a robust value proposition for collaborative data exploration. Potential use cases include enriching classroom experiences by transforming abstract concepts into tangible visual experiences and empowering professionals in fields such as urban planning and product design to make informed, timely decisions. By increasing access to advanced technologies, OpenCIVAN supports interactive remote collaboration for effective problem-solving and helps to prepare a new generation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. This open-source effort aims to: 1) boost the United States\u2019 leadership in immersive computing; 2) create a durable innovation model for collaborative data analysis; and 3) extend the benefits of scientific and technological advances to sectors including education, healthcare, manufacturing, and public policy. \r\n\r\nThis POSE project will scope and plan the development of OpenCIVAN, enabling geographically distributed users to collaborate within immersive, networked environments for interactive data visualization and analytics. The primary objective is to make complex, high-dimensional data more accessible and actionable through real-time, immersive visualization and analysis. By enabling multi-user engagement in rich, interactive environments, the project will foster a more intuitive exploration of scientific datasets, support collaborative problem-solving, and improve the efficiency of interdisciplinary research workflows. The ecosystem will introduce novel visualization techniques that enable users to navigate and interpret multi-modal datasets more effectively. To support real-time collaboration, the project will leverage advanced computing infrastructures, integrating cloud-based services and high-performance computing into a seamless, scalable architecture. The technical scope includes developing modular and interoperable software components for immersive data interaction, enabling flexibility across diverse research domains and platforms. Additionally, the project will establish sustainable governance models for OpenCIVAN to support community-driven development and long-term ecosystem health. Anticipated outcomes include robust tools for remote, immersive collaboration; reproducible workflows that promote scientific rigor; and an extensible open-source framework that supports innovation in multiple critical domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
