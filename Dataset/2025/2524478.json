 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Implementation and Evaluation Project at Regis University aims to improve undergraduate student success and retention in Biology by expanding research opportunities and developing leadership skills through the new Regis Research Fellows Program. This project develops structured, evidence-based experiences that help students build confidence, skills, and a strong sense of belonging in STEM fields leading to increasing student retention and graduation rates. These efforts will also grow the university's capacity to support future STEM students and promote long-term success.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of the project are to (1) increase recruitment and retention of Biology and STEM majors, (2) support undergraduate research and mentoring, and (3) prepare students for leadership roles. The Regis Research Fellows Program includes a coordinated sequence of five activities during a student's first three undergraduate years: course-based undergraduate research in redesigned General Biology labs, paid summer research placements with Regis faculty, mentoring during the academic year, summer research experience at a partner institution, National Jewish Health, and a leadership role as a paid Learning Assistant in Biology courses. Mixed-methods research will be used to assess how students' science identity, research skills, and sense of belonging are impacted. Assessments will be conducted for each of the five activities, then analyzed to determine which activities (alone or in combination) are most effective for student success. Findings will be shared through presentations, publications, and collaboration with other institutions, contributing to best practices for supporting undergraduate STEM students. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
