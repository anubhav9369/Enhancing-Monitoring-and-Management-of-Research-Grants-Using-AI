 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series to be held at Michigan State University during Summer 2026, and the University of Montana in Summer 2027. Operator algebras arose as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, and the field today is a highly active research area. The Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) is a two-week summer school and workshop that aims to provide early-career graduate students with an introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator algebras.\r\n\r\nThe field of operator algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as topology, group theory, probability, and logic, to name a few. The breadth of knowledge required to actively engage in operator algebras can be intimidating; there is a need to provide future researchers with an introduction to fundamental techniques and current research. The objectives of GOALS will be accomplished via lecture series on the basics of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; problem sessions; and expository talks about more advanced topics, as well as evening community-building discussions and a Career Panel. More information about this event is available at the conference website https://users.math.msu.edu/users/banelson/conferences/GOALS.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
