 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington (UW) requests funds for shipboard scientific support equipment needed to facilitate NSF-supported scientific research on board the R/V Thomas G. Thompson and R/V Rachel Carson, two vessels operating as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The specific suite of equipment includes additional funding to replace the Thompson\u2019s heavy lift crane, which is critical for a wide range of scientific instrumentation deployments and general cruise readiness; new winch tension monitoring systems for the Thompson and the Carson to ensure scientific instrumentation deployments are done within accurate wire tension safety parameters; and new scientific refrigeration units for the Thompson\u2019s laboratories, ensuring sensitive samples are reliably stored at accurate temperatures while at sea. All systems contribute directly to support of NSF-funded research.\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 23-525). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance, and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or other organization access to well-maintained, high-quality, calibrated instruments for their research. It ensures the collection of high-quality oceanographic data in support of science, reduces the cost of that research, and expands the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
