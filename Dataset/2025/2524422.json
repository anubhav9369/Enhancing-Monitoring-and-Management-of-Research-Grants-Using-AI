 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at Inter American University of Puerto Rico Metropolitan Campus will strengthen undergraduate learning in biology, microbiology, and natural sciences. Specifically, this project will secure an EVOS M7000 Imaging System, which will allow students to build skills in automated and quantitative fluorescence and brightfield microscopy in General Biology, Botany, Mycology, General Microbiology, Genetics, and Cell & Molecular Biology courses. An estimated 80 students will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. In addition to providing improved experiences in biology courses, the new equipment will also be used in faculty and undergraduate research as well as independent projects.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students by providing critical equipment in biology. Students will be trained in fluorescence microscopy and quantitative imaging analysis, both skills that are in high demand in the biotechnology workforce and related disciplines. The project will assess the impact of the project funded equipment using pre- and post-assessments, the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA), and faculty observations. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
