 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of practical, affordable solutions to strengthen homes in storm-prone areas against wind damage. Severe winds such as hurricanes and tornadoes threaten millions of homes yearly, putting lives at risk and causing billions of dollars in property loss. Many existing residential structures are not built to withstand such events, exposing families to danger and financial hardship. This project explores a reinforcement approach that improves the wind resistance of homes by enhancing key structural connections and increasing the building's ability to withstand extreme weather. The solution is designed to be low-cost, easy to install, and compatible with existing construction practices, making it accessible for widespread implementation. By increasing structural stability, the solution has the potential to save lives, reduce costly repairs, lower insurance claims and preserve property values in vulnerable regions. With over 80 million single-family homes in the United States \u2014 and nearly half located in areas prone to high winds \u2014 the scale of the problem is significant. Broad adoption of this innovation can strengthen community resilience, reduce long-term recovery costs, and support a more stable housing market.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on developing a composite structural connection system that enhances wind resilience in wood-framed buildings by establishing a continuous and uniform load path. Unlike traditional fastening methods that rely on discrete connectors such as nails or screws that are prone to stress concentration and failure under uplift \u2014 this system integrates elastomeric adhesive bonding with dimensional wood blocks at key connection points. This method forms an adhesive interface between framing members, roof sheathing, and the foundation, enabling distributed stress transfer while reducing the risk of localized failure during high-wind events. The technical innovation leverages the application of advanced adhesive dynamics in combination with structural wood behavior to deliver superior uplift resistance, validated through experimental cyclic and static testing. Analytical modeling further supports its effectiveness by quantifying stress redistribution, and connection durability under repeated wind loading. This solution is designed for the ease of application in both new construction and retrofit scenarios, requiring minimal occupant disruption. The system\u2019s compatibility with existing framing configurations and compliance with building codes positions this method as a feasible upgrade over conventional retrofitting approaches. The outcome of this project could establish new design standards in residential construction, enhance disaster resilience, and broaden the application of composite material science in structural engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
