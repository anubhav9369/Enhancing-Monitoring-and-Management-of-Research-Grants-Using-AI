 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support U.S.-based researchers to participate in the conference \u201cBeyond Uniform Hyperbolicity\u201d (BUH), to take place at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy, from June 2 to June 13, 2025. This conference, the eleventh in a long-standing series held every 2\u20133 years since 2001, has been hosted in various locations worldwide, including twice in the United States. The main theme of the event is dynamics, a subfield of pure mathematics that models complex phenomena -- such as the motion of gas molecules in confined spaces, weather patterns, and planetary motion -- and provides critical theoretical insights into a range of scientific fields. Building on its successful history of advancing knowledge, BUH 2025 will offer a valuable opportunity for emerging researchers to engage with leading experts, explore current research topics, and forge new collaborations. The conference format, featuring six mini-courses and a selection of stand-alone talks, has proven highly effective for advanced learning. Moreover, the welcoming environment of ICTP will foster meaningful interactions between researchers of all backgrounds and experience levels. The conference websites are: https://indico.ictp.it/event/10841 (first week), https://indico.ictp.it/event/10935 (second week).\r\n \r\nThis conference focuses on the most significant advancements in the study of dynamical systems exhibiting various forms of hyperbolicity. The topics covered by BUH 2025 will include: weak hyperbolicity (partial hyperbolicity, nonuniform hyperbolicity, singular hyperbolicity, positive Lyapunov exponent); random dynamics and stationary measures; physical (Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen and u-Gibbs) measures; statistical properties (decay of correlations, limit theorems, speed of mixing); entropy theory and coding for dynamics with hyperbolicity; holomorphic dynamics and hyperbolicity; group actions and smooth rigidity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
