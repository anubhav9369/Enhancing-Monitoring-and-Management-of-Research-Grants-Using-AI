 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center on Responsible AI and Governance (CRAIG) brings together leading academics, businesses, and government agencies to develop the knowledge and workforce required to pursue artificial intelligence that is safe, accurate, impartial, and accountable. Expert faculty from four universities (Ohio State, Baylor, Northeastern, and Rutgers) and disciplines ranging from computer science to law, business, and the social sciences, work with industry and government partners to identify the most pressing responsible AI challenges and develop scalable solutions and the workforce required to implement them. By advancing trustworthy and responsible AI, CRAIG increases the acceptance and adoption of AI, thereby promoting competitiveness and national security.\r\n\r\nCRAIG will generate practice-informed research and forward-looking workforce development. CRAIG project teams investigate core questions such as how to design more accurate and safe generative AI systems; which AI governance technologies and strategies best achieve social and business goals; how to audit deployed AI models; how to provide privacy and transparency in smart, sensed environments; and how to engage constructively with ethical challenges pertaining to AI. The research teams\u2019 multiple disciplinary lenses enable them to perceive how technology, law, ethics, and business management interact with and impact one another, and so to generate fresh and practical insights and translational solutions. Baylor University, leverages its expertise in preventing AI errors and improving AI interpretability to strengthen CRAIGs research-based solutions. In combination with its research efforts, CRAIG educates and trains the next generation of responsible AI professionals. The Center provides students with research experiences, internships, \u201creal world\u201d mentors, and curricular innovations, and current employees with continuing and executive education, in the new and growing field of responsible AI. Baylor leverages its deep experience with training programs that prepare students and professionals in cybersecurity, healthcare, and business to help realize these educational aims. CRAIG\u2019s research and educational pillars provide businesses and governments with the knowledge and workforce development approaches required to achieve safer and more trustworthy AI. Thus, the project contributes to the building of a more sustainable, prosperous, and secure AI economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
