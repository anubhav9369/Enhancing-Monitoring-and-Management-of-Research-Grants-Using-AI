 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Research Training Course (ARTC)  in Physiology, offered at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), operates for 6-weeks over the summer and is designed for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. The course serves as a platform for developing networks around theory-driven cell biology and bioengineering. A goal is to integrate training across disciplines - both horizontally (within the biological sciences) and vertically (with physics, engineering and computational sciences).  This will result in coordinated transdisciplinary networks for research discovery, powered by collaborations, publications, and workforce development which we are calling RCN- QCB, short for Research Collaboration Networks for Quantitative Cell Biology. The overall goal of this project is to grow a research network focused on the intersection of training in the biological physical, and engineering sciences, that will create a matrix of support for both scientists and the research enterprise.\r\n                                      \r\nThe Physiology course is uniquely poised to accomplish this goal as it has long been a meeting ground for students with backgrounds in both the biological and physical sciences. Notably it serves as an incubator for discovery and networking that creates launching points through collaborations.  The course\u2019s focus on \u201cModern Cell Biology\u201d has grown to encompass topics in cell and molecular biology, developmental biology, and biophysics. The course also operates during a time frame that overlaps with other ARTCs: Embryology, Microbial Diversity, Neural Systems and Biology of Parasitism. Moreover, there are further opportunities for synergistic interactions with the NSF-sponsored Center for Living Systems (CLS).  Leveraging the overlap with these other MBL activities, we will further increase the integrative nature of training. This creates an untapped opportunity to develop exciting collaborations outside the participants\u2019 comfort zones and traditional research silos and expand the network.  Furthermore, RCN: QBC is committed to efforts to increase the participation in the inquiry of discovery, and opportunities within the STEM workforce in ways that benefit the broader scientific community and lay public, through targeted efforts in expanding alumni networking opportunities and engaging K-12 programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
