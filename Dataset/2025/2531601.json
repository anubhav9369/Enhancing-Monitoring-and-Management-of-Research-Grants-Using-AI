 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel for graduate and undergraduate students from US institutions to participate in programs coordinated with the 2025 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2025), which will be held in Melbourne, Australia, from November 9 to 13. ICAPS is a premier conference in Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on planning and scheduling, which are critical components for optimizing complex decision-making across various domains. The methods developed in this community have been applied in robotics, transportation, healthcare, and many other fields. As part of the program, the students will participate in the Doctoral Consortium and the Launchpad workshop. \r\n\r\nThe ICAPS 2025 Conference Doctoral Consortium is geared toward doctoral graduate students to present their research and receive feedback from leading AI researchers, while the Launchpad workshop is designed for undergraduate and master's students to get involved in the field of automated planning and scheduling. All the students will have the opportunity to present their work, discuss, and network with leading AI researchers. There will also be separate mentoring sessions to provide guidance that could help the students achieve further success in their research and professional careers. Through these activities, this project will help the students build professional connections, learn more about cutting-edge research in AI, and provide opportunities to further engage in research. In this way, the project seeks to nurture and promote the new generation of AI scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
