 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Genetically Encoded Materials (C-GEM) develops new biologically inspired methods to precisely tailor and build molecules. C-GEM is re-engineering the ribosome and its attendant enzymes to build complex molecules one bond at a time in a precise sequence, much like natural ribosomes build proteins by assembling alpha-amino acids in sequence. They are also inventing new chemistry to subsequently modify these materials to introduce additional functionality. Through the research, C-GEM trains collaborative teams of students and postdoctoral researchers at a rich new interface of chemistry and biology. C-GEM also engages citizen scientists with a scientific discovery game, EteRNA, that introduces interested gamers to the key concepts of RNA structure, stability, and function.\r\n \r\nC-GEM\u2019s research plan includes interrelated goals that will expand ribosome-mediated chemistry to generate molecular architectures unique in both structure and function. Novel experimental and computational tools to design, evolve, and characterize the molecules of translation will expand their chemical capacity in vitro and in vivo. The novel molecules and materials produced will probe the fundamental chemistry of peptides, impact human health and open new opportunities in bio-materials design. Education and participation programs integrate research, workforce development for biotechnology, and public engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
