 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Division of Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs in response to the solicitation of proposals for equipment that promote the reduced consumption of helium initiated by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The University of Oklahoma (OU) is acquiring a helium recovery and liquefier system to support the viability of the core facility consisting of five nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers to support the research of Professor John W. Peters along with colleagues Steven P. Crossley, Indrajeet Sharma, Shanteri Singh, and Yitong Dong. The NMR spectrometers facilitate research in the OU Chemistry and Biochemistry Department of eight tenure-track faculty members conducting research on synthetic organic, bioorganic, and inorganic chemistry. Acquiring this helium recovery system also enhances the abilities of several other research groups at OU to conduct research, including the Department of Biochemical Engineering and the Department of Chemical, Biological, and Materials Engineering. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The superconducting magnets of these instruments rely on regular deliveries of liquid helium to maintain their operation. However, the instability in the helium supply due to global and national challenges jeopardizes research programs relying on NMR spectroscopy. This helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff from the superconducting magnets and then reliquefies the helium for its reuse. This equipment also supports the educational, research, and teaching efforts of undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at supporting research and research training at all levels. The NMR instrumentation supported by this equipment enables research projects focused on methodologies for organic synthesis, methodologies for polymer upcycling and recycling, and chemoenzymatic methodologies for synthesis. Additionally, the recovery system aids in supporting investigations focusing on the synthesis and characterization of biomimicking molecules. The helium recovery system also supports hands-on experience operating NMR spectrometers which is essential to OU\u2019s large number of undergraduate students engaged in organic chemistry laboratories and in advanced laboratory courses covering structure elucidation, organic, bioorganic, and inorganic synthesis, physical chemistry, and undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
