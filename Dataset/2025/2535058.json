 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the commercialization of polymer beads for the fast, effective treatment of samples for wastewater testing. Using these small polymer beads, the shelf life of wastewater samples can be greatly extended, alleviating the requirement for cold-chain storage. Currently, the refrigeration process required for sample handling to ensure reliable and accurate results suffers from high costs, greatly limiting the implementation of large-scale wastewater testing. This technology offers promising applications for virus testing in wastewater. The beads provide opportunities to advance and facilitate sample preservation and monitoring of potential contaminants not only in developed areas but also in resource-limited environments where in-person testing is uncommon and unreliable. The beads can be produced in large quantities at low cost. Additionally, as more applications based on the technology are developed, the outcomes of this solution may also benefit disease monitoring and therapeutic interventions.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. As wastewater is chemically and biologically complex, the handling, storage, and transportation of wastewater samples without refrigeration is extremely challenging. Additionally, due to the high costs of implementation, refrigerated storage and transportation may not be feasible or sufficient, especially in resource-limited settings. This solution is based on the development of a refrigeration-free microbial sampling and storage technology using porous superabsorbent polymer beads. The millimeter-sized beads are prepared by a dry-bath batch method via polymerization induced phase separation using low-cost starting materials. The analytical targets (e.g., pathogens or surrogates) can be captured and immediately preserved in the beads, then released from the beads for subsequent lab testing on demand. The beads use a well-controlled sieving structure to absorb and stabilize the targets in liquids like wastewater, while eliminating possible contaminants. The stabilized samples have an extended shelf life in this purified environment at room temperature. This technology could provide an effective and inexpensive method for wide-scale refrigeration-free microbial sampling and storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
