 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second annual conference of the Northern and Central California Section of SIAM (SIAM-NCC) will be held October 27\u201328, 2025, at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This event brings together researchers from academia, industry, national laboratories, and government to strengthen regional collaboration in applied and computational mathematics. The conference aims to: (1) create an opportunity for scientific researchers to meet, network, and share the innovations and recent developments in their fields; (2) attract and energize students and researchers working in applied and computational mathematics and related fields; (3) offer SIAM members from all institutions in the NCC region the opportunity to attend a local meeting of the community; (4) provide early career researchers the access and opportunities to connect with others who are at similar career stages; (5) inspire the next generation of applied and computational mathematicians to get involved in the community and to innovate through research and education.\r\n\r\nConference themes align with SIAM Activity Groups and include mathematical analysis, optimization, inverse problems, experimental design, high-performance computing, uncertainty quantification, scientific machine learning, AI, and digital twins. The program will feature two plenary talks, eight thematic sessions, two panels, two poster sessions with blitz presentations, a mentoring event, a CV/interviewing workshop, and guided tours of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the Advanced Light Source (ALS). The presenters will come from academia, industry, and national laboratories, representing many scientific backgrounds, career stages, and institutional affiliations. The themes and speakers for each thematic session will be selected via an open call and coordinated by the Technical Program Committee. More information is available at the conference: https://siamncc25.lbl.gov.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
