 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless networks are complex systems that rely on integrating different software components to work correctly. This project brings people and communities together to build better wireless networks that everyone can use. The effort combines different open-source tools (free software that anyone can modify) to make it easier to create new types of wireless networks. This solution helps researchers, businesses, and communities access and develop better ways to provide wireless connectivity. The project aims to improve how people communicate and creates new opportunities for learning and starting businesses.\r\n\r\nIn this project, funded by the Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems program, the challenge is to integrate fragmented open-source efforts by combining mature projects into one ready and user-friendly solution. This integration creates a complete, open-source reference architecture for 5G and future networks. The project uses test beds to continuously host and test the software and includes a suite of tools that help open-source developers build and test robust wireless network code. Additionally, the project focuses on community building through outreach, clear documentation, and hands-on workshops that attract new developers and users. This coordinated strategy enables the smooth application of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning methods within next-generation networks, paving the way for innovations that move quickly from research to real-world use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
