 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular damage can result from an imbalance between free-radicals and antioxidants, also known as oxidative stress. When the production of free radicals overcomes the body\u2019s antioxidant defenses, chronic health conditions and an increased risk of mortality may develop. Childhood is a particularly critical period for caloric requirements (children spend ~50% more calories each day than adults when adjusted for body size), but their increased caloric expenditure can also amplify the body\u2019s production of free radicals. At the same time, antioxidant defenses are energetically costly, and during childhood they can take calories away from growth and development. This study examines the complex relationship between free radicals and total calories used in a day in a group of children (ages 3-10). Results are shared with stakeholders, activities are developed with schools and youth organizations, and students receive STEM training. The study provides practical insights for public health priorities and disease prevention. \r\n\r\nTo further current understanding of human life history trade-offs, this study investigates oxidative stress in relation to Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) in a group of children (3-10 years old, n = 70). The study builds upon an ongoing longitudinal study as well as robust pilot testing. The study determines how child TEE relates to oxidative stress by measuring TEE using doubly labeled water and by establishing the Oxidative Stress Index (urinary 8-OHdG; OSI). The selected methods allow for the study to measure oxidative damage levels relative to antioxidant activity. These bioassays are complemented with household-level information regarding food and nutrition. The study provides practical insights for public health priorities and disease prevention. The study's methodological approach advances NSF priorities for investments in biotechnological innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
