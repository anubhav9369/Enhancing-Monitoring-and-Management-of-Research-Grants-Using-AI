 "awd_abstract_narration": "Niagara County Community College (SUNY Niagara) will address the critical workforce need for skilled technicians and operators in Industrial and Mechanical Technology within the Western New York region. This project will expand upon previous successes achieved through a prior Track One, New-to-ATE initiative focused on welding technology and metal fabrication programs. Over this three-year project, student enrollment will increase to fifty students recruited to complete credit-bearing courses resulting either in credit-bearing Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees in Mechanical Technology: Mechanical Design and Industrial Process Technology or in two new micro-credential programs aligned with industry manufacturing needs. The project will concentrate on occupations experiencing rapid growth but simultaneously facing significant workforce shortages due to retirements and hiring challenges. Selected for investment through the College's Program Advisory Committee process, these programs will undergo comprehensive modernization to foster experiential learning, create clear career pathways, and broaden workforce pipelines. By enhancing instructional equipment, materials, and faculty credentialing, the project will significantly improve hands-on learning experiences. The initiative is anticipated to have substantial impacts beyond the institution, serving as a replicable model for similar programs nationwide.\r\n\r\nGoals of the project include modernization of Industrial and Mechanical Technology programs through strategic curriculum redesign, integration of advanced instructional technologies, and development of modular, stackable micro-credentials specifically targeting Introductory Manual Machining and Intermediate CNC Machining competencies. Faculty will engage in credentialing enhancement to advance understanding of distinct machining skillset development. The College will investigate conditions under which improved student learning occurs and align instructional methodologies with contemporary industry standards. Programmatic coherence will be reinforced through structured partnerships with Niagara County high school districts, facilitating collaborative calibration activities, including annual competitive and preparatory events such as \"Tech Wars\" and \"Advanced Manufacturing Prep\" (AMP). These initiatives will enable direct interaction among secondary students, educators, and collegiate faculty to ensure curriculum relevance and efficacy. Robust industry engagement is secured via formal commitments from eight regional manufacturing enterprises which will comprise an active Industry Advisory Council throughout the project duration, as well as strategic partnership with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Niagara County Workforce Development Board. This alignment, structured to expand student pipeline capacity and graduate skillset competency outcomes with sector-specific employment demands. Project objectives are intended to substantially mitigate workforce shortages and foster sustainable regional economic advancement. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
