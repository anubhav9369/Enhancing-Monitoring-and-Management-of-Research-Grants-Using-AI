 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biotechnology is a fast-growing part of the U.S. economy, offering important benefits to society, even as companies face ongoing challenges in finding enough skilled workers. In the four-county service area of Metropolitan Community College (MCC) in the greater Omaha, NE region, home to about 42% of the state's population, there is currently no biotechnology training program to meet the growing demand for trained technicians. This project introduces a new program focused on hands-on biotechnology training, with an emphasis on biomanufacturing, to help meet local workforce needs for entry-level technicians. By offering this kind of training, MCC opens doors for students to enter a high-demand, high-wage field while also strengthening the regional economy. Expanding the biotechnology workforce supports local industries, creates opportunities for students, and contributes to the vitality of the greater Omaha community.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to 1) develop a hands-on training program that includes three stackable credentials and four new biotechnology courses, 2) equip a state-of-the-art biotechnology lab that reflects current industry practices, 3) build on existing partnerships with regional industries to support faculty training, and 4) raise awareness of biotechnology through a multi-faceted recruitment campaign. A Business and Industry Leadership Team will guide curriculum development, ensure alignment with workforce needs, and coordinate internships and sponsorships. To build awareness and support recruitment, the project includes youth summer camps, a high school academy, a Biotech Teacher Academy to train local high school teachers, and on-campus events for prospective students. Collectively, these efforts aim to create a pathway to future biotechnology technicians. Project outcomes and materials are planned for broad dissemination through open-access platforms, including professional journals, conferences, and the ATE Central website, supporting STEM education, educator development, and greater public understanding of biotechnology and its career pathways. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
