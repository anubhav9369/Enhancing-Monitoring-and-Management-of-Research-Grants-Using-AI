 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnology has rapidly emerged as an interdisciplinary field with transformative applications across medicine, energy, and national defense. At Northwestern University, the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN) leads one of the nation\u2019s foremost research efforts in this area. The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Nanoscale Science and Engineering at Northwestern will provide undergraduate cohorts from various science and engineering backgrounds with immersive, nine-week summer research experiences. Students will engage in hands-on, goal-driven projects under the mentorship of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, gaining critical thinking skills and exposure to real-world laboratory environments. An educated and motivated scientific workforce is essential to sustaining national progress in science and technology, and undergraduate research experience plays a pivotal role in cultivating this talent. This REU Site promotes interdisciplinary learning across chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering, preparing students to contribute meaningfully to the field of nanotechnology. Over the past decade, REU sites hosted by the IIN have trained more than 330 undergraduates and generated over 130 publications with student co-authors. This REU site is committed to broadening participation among students with limited access to research opportunities, with the goal of expanding interest in STEM and cultivating the next generation of scientists and engineers in the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is a critical need for the creation of a strong workforce of world-class scientists, engineers, and educators with knowledge and technical skills in nanotechnology. Researchers at Northwestern University (NU) have made substantial contributions to this field, and the university has gained a reputation for its rigorous nanotechnology research programs. This nine-week, immersive summer program is designed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, provide undergraduates with hands-on research opportunities in chemistry, biology, medicine, physics, and multiple engineering disciplines, all united by a focus on nanoscience and nanotechnology. The program\u2019s recruitment and selection process will encompass inclusive practices to ensure that all outreach and participation opportunities are open and available to all Americans, in alignment with NSF\u2019s commitment to broad accessibility. Each selected student will be carefully paired with a research project based on their noted interests and experience provided in their application. They will be guided by a faculty mentor and a graduate or postdoctoral researcher, with the goal of progressing from structured supervision towards independent experimentation. Participants gain experience in experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication, supported by workshops in public speaking, technical writing, and research ethics. Additional activities include visits to a National Laboratory, seminars, and social events that foster community and professional development. Students present their research at a final symposium and in a written technical report, which may be submitted for publication.  Through this program, participants acquire the skills and experience necessary for future success in furthering their education, and/or entering the American workforce, securing our nation\u2019s leadership at the forefront of science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
