 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid growth of semiconductor manufacturing, quantum technologies, and optics offers a vital opportunity to strengthen regional economic development and workforce capacity in Central New York. Yet many adults face barriers to entering these high-demand fields due to limited exposure, financial constraints, and unclear pathways into education and training. This project expands access to these emerging technologies by providing flexible, hands-on learning opportunities that build technical skills, career navigation strategies, and industry connections. By opening pathways into these high-tech industries, the project advances STEM education, enhances economic resilience, and supports the progress of science by preparing individuals for meaningful careers. This initiative benefits society by helping local residents pursue new opportunities in advanced technology sectors of semiconductors and quantum, ensuring that the region can fully contribute to the nation\u2019s scientific and economic growth.\r\nThe project will develop and deliver a hybrid curriculum introducing adult learners to emerging fields in semiconductors, quantum technologies, and optics through experiential, problem-based learning. Instruction will incorporate foundational technical concepts, hands-on laboratory experiences, and exposure to industry-relevant processes and tools. Recruitment will focus on adult learners through partnerships with community organizations and workforce agencies, providing flexible, in-person and virtual engagement opportunities. Participants will receive financial support, personalized mentoring, and career navigation assistance to promote participation and completion. A multi-year evaluation plan will track growth in technical skills, confidence in STEM learning, and participant engagement with industry pathways. Active collaboration with industry partners will guide curriculum updates and ensure alignment with evolving workforce needs while offering mentorship and networking opportunities. Outcomes and instructional resources will be shared through an open-access platform to encourage broader adoption of effective, hands-on STEM learning models for non-traditional learners.\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
