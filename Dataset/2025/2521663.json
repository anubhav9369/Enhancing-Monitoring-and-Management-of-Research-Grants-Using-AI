 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human bipedal walking underlies numerous aspects of our ecology and behavior. Knowledge of foot anatomy and function is essential because the foot interfaces directly with the ground during walking or running, and it is important to understand how variation in foot anatomy may impact biomechanics. This research advances current understandings of hominin bipedalism by integrating anatomic and kinematic data and developing AI-driven 3D computational foot models for apes and humans. The study provides funding and training for students and includes outreach activities directed to the public. Results from this study aid in the development of new translational methods for investigating anatomical variation associated with foot pathology (e.g., flat feet) and inform about the effects of footwear on foot muscle use and soft tissue disorders (e.g., plantar fasciitis).  \r\n\r\nThis study applies an integrative experimental modeling-simulation approach. The study conducts direct comparisons regarding the intrinsic foot biomechanics of human and ape, informing and comparing their musculoskeletal design. The study: (1) conducts loading experiments on human and ape feet; (2) builds musculoskeletal models of human and ape feet; (3) integrates experimental data with these models to calculate intrinsic foot dynamics, and; (4) performs dynamic simulations to link intrinsic foot musculoskeletal structure to walking kinematics, kinetics, muscle activation, and metabolic cost. Advanced AI-supported computational modeling techniques are applied to test long-held ideas regarding the form-function relationships in hominin feet. The study informs interpretations of the hominin fossil record, yields soft tissue and mechanical property data, and generates detailed musculoskeletal models that inform translational research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
