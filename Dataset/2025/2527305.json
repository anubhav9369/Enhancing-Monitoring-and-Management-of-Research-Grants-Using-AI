 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this BRITE Pivot project is to support research studying computational methods to manage traffic more efficiently when disruptions occur due to accidents, cyber infrastructure failures, or sudden changes in driver behavior. These disruptions lead to nonequilibrium traffic, which is common but difficult to formulate, predict, or control, especially across large transportation networks. Traditional tools often fall short in aiding response promptly. This project seeks to integrate quantum computing with classical methods to build smarter systems that can predict and manage sudden traffic changes in real time. In addition to reducing congestion, improving road safety, and cutting emissions, the results look to advance broader goals of economic productivity and sustainability.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted in association with this project tackles the growing challenge of managing traffic systems that are increasingly complex and connected. With more vehicles relying on real-time information and communication technologies, traffic is shaped by not only nearby vehicles but also signals from across the network (e.g., downstream road conditions or rerouting guidance). This invites the question, namely, how we leverage the power of quantum algorithms and machine learning to better predict traffic jams, reroute vehicles, and improve the reliability of our transportation systems. To answer this question, the project seeks to design new algorithms that can process vast amounts of information and make prompt, informed decisions under rapidly changing system dynamics. New ways to represent traffic as a complex, high-dimensional system will be explored, drawing inspiration from quantum systems. The developed tools could be extended to infrastructure management, emergency response and other applications. The project also trains students in emerging technologies and prepare the future STEM workforce for the quantum era.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
