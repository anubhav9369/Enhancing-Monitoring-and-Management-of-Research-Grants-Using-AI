 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Bureau of the Census defines rural as areas with less than 2000 houses or less than 5000 residents in its 2020 census. Based on this definition, about 20% of the U.S. population lives in rural areas. Rural areas cover more than 90% of the U.S. land, providing essential resources like water, food, energy, and recreation. Therefore, rural areas play a significant role in the social and economic spheres of the U.S.  Promoting the resilience and development of rural America can profoundly impact the entire country. Compared with the urban population, rural residents tend to have lower average educational attainment, an older age profile, and face higher rates of poverty, food insecurity, and housing instability. They also have fewer job opportunities and less discretionary income. As a result, rural residents are often less able to cope with social and economic shocks and stay resilient amidst high inflation and interest rate disruptions.\r\n\r\nThis research project aims to comprehensively evaluate the social and economic challenges experienced by rural residents and businesses. The study will explore the socioeconomic impacts on rural households and businesses. Research methods will include interviews and surveys, analysis of various coping strategies for maintaining resilience, and identification of persistent obstacles to recovery and growth. By providing valuable insights to policymakers, community leaders, and other key stakeholders, the project will enable the translation of targeted interventions addressing the distinct needs of rural Americans. Project outcomes have potential to contribute significantly to understanding rural economic dynamics and promoting rural communities\u2019 long-term resilience and prosperity across the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
