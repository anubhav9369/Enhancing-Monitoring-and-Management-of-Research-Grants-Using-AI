 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project utilizes generative artificial intelligence to create high-quality synthetic data that accurately represents complex real-world information\u2014such as medical images, financial records, and social media text\u2014while ensuring individual privacy is protected. By providing scientists, engineers, and students with safe and realistic data sets, the project accelerates discovery, strengthens the nation\u2019s technological workforce, and supports informed decision-making in health, commerce, and security. Additionally, the open benchmarks and instructional materials generated by the project encourage participation in data science, allowing everyone to contribute to and benefit from scientific advancements.\r\n\r\nThe research develops a unified Generative Prediction and Inference framework that combines diffusion processes, normalizing flows, and transfer learning to model joint distributions of tabular and unstructured modalities. The framework samples synthetic multimodal data to improve supervised tasks such as image captioning and question answering, delivers calibrated uncertainty estimates, and tests for hallucinations in large language models. Key contributions include algorithms for domain adaptation, reliability metrics for trustworthy AI, and agent-based tools that automate analysis of complex datasets. The resulting software and evaluation suites establish new standards for multimodal data synthesis and statistical inference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
