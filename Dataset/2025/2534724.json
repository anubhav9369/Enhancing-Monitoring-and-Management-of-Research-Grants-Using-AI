 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project requests NSF support for travel awards that will enable students based in the United States to attend the 8th AAAI ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES 2025), to be held October 20 to 22, 2025, at IE University Tower in Madrid, Spain. AIES is a leading interdisciplinary venue that brings together researchers from computer science, law, philosophy, economics, sociology, and public policy to explore the ethical and societal impacts of artificial intelligence. The conference focuses on topics such as fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and the broader implications of AI systems in society.\r\n\r\nThese travel awards will provide students from a range of institutions, including those with fewer international research opportunities, with valuable access to the AIES community. Participants will benefit from mentoring by senior researchers, exposure to new ideas in responsible AI, and engagement in discussions at the intersection of AI technology and society. The program supports NSF priorities by strengthening the pipeline of future researchers prepared to address complex challenges at the intersection of AI and society. The awards will also enhance international collaboration and broaden the intellectual diversity of participants, contributing to the United States\u2019 leadership in advancing responsible and innovative AI practices globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
