 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to train and develop a skilled technical workforce that keeps pace with modernization of manufacturing technologies and meets industry demand for advanced manufacturing proficiencies.  The emphasis on developing advanced manufacturing skills among veterans, their families, and active-duty military personnel transitioning to the civilian workforce will contribute to the nation's prosperity, the state of Arizona's economic security, and the financial security of participants. Participants\u2019 inherent knowledge and experience in how the military works complement advanced technology skills, increasing their potential to secure national defense through future employment by the Department of Defense and defense contractors who supply products and equipment to the military. Building blocks that progressively develop skills needed to earn industry-recognized credentials via hands-on experiential learning within an ecosystem of social support will strengthen those who lack confidence in successfully pursuing a related STEM career. More broadly, the proposed effort will determine the components and impactfulness of community-based cross-sector partnerships that intentionally serve participants by providing timely and essential educational, professional, and social supports that collectively address barriers to improve persistence and success. It will also translate findings to address broader workforce development gaps and recommend adaptations to other groups, thus contributing to the goal of making America skilled again.\r\n\r\nParticipants will engage in hands-on training with ASU's industrial robotics and manufacturing equipment and instructors. Upon completing the labs and modules, they will earn a digitally verified Micro-Badge \u2014a stackable credential aligned with industry needs and developed with input from partners such as Aerospec and JagCo. These courses are designed to support skills-based education (SE), foster career readiness in advanced technology, grow personal career ownership, and adaptability. While actual job placements are beyond the scope of the program, participants will be eligible for internships or employment opportunities through partner networks, such as AZ Coalition for Military Families, ASU\u2019s Office for Veteran & Military Academic Engagement, AZNext, Intersources, and TechStaff. Long-term outcomes will be documented through follow-up reports and a qualitative rubric. \r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
