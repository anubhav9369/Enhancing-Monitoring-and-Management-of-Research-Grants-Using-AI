 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Level 3 IUSE project, a collaborative effort between Randolph Community College and Chandler-Gilbert Community College, aims to address persistent challenges in undergraduate mathematics education. Specifically, this project looks to accelerate the adoption of active, evidence-based teaching strategies in community college precalculus algebra courses nationwide. Many students, particularly at community colleges, encounter barriers in foundational mathematics courses that can hinder their progression into STEM fields. This project will equip instructors with the tools, resources, and support to transition from passive, lecture-based methods to more engaging and effective student-centered approaches. This project will develop and refine high-quality Open Educational Resources (OER) for precalculus algebra tailored for active learning, produce an innovative multi-episode expository documentary showcasing active learning in a community college setting, and develop online professional development. By fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and enhancing student engagement, this project endeavors to improve student success, retention, and persistence and reduce mathematics as a challenge to STEM success.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to explore how mathematics instructors transition from lecture-based instruction to active learning methods in community college settings. Project activities will highlight the critical support instructors need to transition to student-centered active learning that have demonstrated potential to support positive student outcomes. This project will achieve its goals in four ways: (1) creating, modifying, and curating OERs for precalculus algebra; (2) producing and sharing a documentary that captures active learning techniques, features instructor and student perspectives, and highlights the transformation of teaching practices; (3) designing and delivering online professional development to train instructors in implementing these strategies effectively; and (4) conducting mixed-methods research to investigate how mathematics instructors transition to active learning, identify crucial support mechanisms, and explore how the project documentary and professional development drive instructional change. Data collection will involve faculty surveys, classroom observations, and interviews. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
