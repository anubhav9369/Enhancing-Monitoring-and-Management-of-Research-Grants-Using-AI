 "awd_abstract_narration": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in the technologies used by both students and teachers, it is essential for them to understand how to be safe while using AI. Furthermore, AI and cybersecurity technology together are better at detecting malicious activities than conventional security systems. The need to blend the two disciplines into a single, integrated curriculum for K-8 education is highlighted by the interconnectedness of AI and cybersecurity as complementary systems. This project will \"plant the seeds\" of these literacies by spiraling content on topics from computer programming, internet fundamentals, and introduction to data and AI along with cybersecurity topics in small doses throughout students' K-8 education. This project will lay the foundation for the students to eventually develop a comprehensive understanding of how different technologies work and interact. This project aims to investigate how teachers from rural schools approach the integration of computer science (CS), and in particular, AI and cybersecurity components, into their existing curricula. This project will directly impact at least 82 rural teachers from South Carolina through multi-year participation in professional development and coaching and approximately 8,100 students indirectly in their classrooms. Resources, including lesson plans, developed through the project will be made available as open access on the project website, through partnerships, and via conference presentations and publications.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to improve STEM teaching and learning by examining successful teacher professional development (PD) models in response to a need for preparing students with both STEM literacy skills and other technical competencies needed to be informed citizens and contributors to society. The project will blend AI and cybersecurity into a unified curricula, supported by the following objectives: (1) analyze how K-8 educators incorporate AI and cybersecurity topics into disciplinary teaching components; (2) explore the learning supports that K-8 educators need to effectively incorporate AI and cybersecurity topics into current curricula to assist students in meeting content-focused learning objectives; and (3) compare the integration opportunities available to K-8 educators in rural areas of South Carolina. In the end, hypothesizing that this research can form the basis for the creation of more scalable PD programs for K-8 teachers as well as continuous assistance with CS integration. The research will follow a mixed-methods design, combining survey data, classroom observations, and interviews to examine how educators make sense of and apply these concepts over time. Statistical analyses will identify significant patterns across teacher implementation contexts. Qualitative data--drawn from semi-structured interviews, teaching artifacts, video documentation, and field notes--will be coded to surface pedagogical strategies, challenges, and evolving teacher understandings. In addition, an app will be created to allow teachers to document real-time classroom integration of AI and cybersecurity, providing a robust, longitudinal dataset. The findings will inform scalable, context-sensitive professional development models and contribute to a broader understanding of how to support interdisciplinary CS learning in K-8 settings. All data collection will be designed to ensure methodological rigor and trustworthiness through triangulation and ongoing member checks with participating educators.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by NSF's DRK-12 and ITEST programs. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
