 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) is a cooperative initiative involving 10 federal agencies and 217 recipient institutions managing federally-sponsored research funds. FDP works to reduce the administrative burdens associated with research grants and contracts. The goal is to increase research productivity by streamlining the administrative process for research while ensuring effective stewardship of and full accountability for federal funds. More specifically, FDP strives to maximize research performance per federal dollar by minimizing the monetary and time burdens associated with the administrative aspects of federally-sponsored research. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine serves as the secretariat for FDP.\r\n\r\nFDP\u2019s approximately 600 institutional and federal representatives work together at three annual meetings and in collaborative working groups where members exchange thoughts, ideas, and feedback on current and proposed research administration policies and processes; work towards reducing administrative burdens associated with federal research grants and contracts; identify potential improvements and initiatives; and demonstrate possible solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
