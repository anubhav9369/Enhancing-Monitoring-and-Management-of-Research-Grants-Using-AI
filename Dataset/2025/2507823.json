 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Fast-Track Phase I project is to improve the efficiency and reliability of water purification processes in advanced manufacturing, particularly in the semiconductor industry, while addressing the growing challenges of global water scarcity. Semiconductor fabrication requires large volumes of ultrapure water, which is produced using extensive filtration and chemical treatment to remove contaminants that can affect manufacturing yield and product reliability. Current methods, such as reverse osmosis, require significant pre- and post-treatment, increasing costs, energy consumption, and operational complexity. This project aims to develop a new membrane technology that uses applied pressure to induce distillation, allowing for the removal of difficult-to-filter contaminants while reducing the need for chemical additives and additional processing steps. In addition to benefiting semiconductor manufacturing, this technology has the potential to improve desalination and wastewater reuse, providing a more efficient and scalable solution for producing clean water in regions facing water shortages. By simplifying water purification, reducing energy consumption, and eliminating costly chemical treatments, this innovation could lower operating costs for industrial water users, support domestic semiconductor production, and help address critical water challenges worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project introduces a novel pressure-driven distillation membrane that enables water purification without the need for high thermal energy input or extensive chemical pre-treatment. Unlike traditional filtration membranes, this approach uses applied pressure to drive phase separation, selectively removing contaminants such as boron, urea, silica, and disinfection byproducts that are difficult to filter with existing membrane technologies. The research will focus on optimizing membrane fabrication, assessing selectivity and durability under operational conditions, and integrating the membrane into a scalable module suitable for semiconductor manufacturing, desalination, and wastewater reuse applications. Experimental validation will include performance testing under industrially relevant conditions, long-term stability analysis, and pilot-scale testing with industry partners. This work will advance the development of a next-generation membrane system capable of improving water quality while reducing chemical usage and operational complexity in high-tech manufacturing sectors and large-scale water treatment facilities. If successful, this technology will offer a more efficient and sustainable approach to water purification, benefiting industries and communities that rely on clean water for production and daily use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
