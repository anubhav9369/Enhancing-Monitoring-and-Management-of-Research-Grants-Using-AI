 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the translation of an advanced air filtration system designed to capture both particulate matter and carbon dioxide emissions in real-time. These efforts aim to assess the potential for air pollution mitigation, particularly within the construction and urban development sectors, where emissions from equipment, dust, and site activity contribute heavily to local environmental and health challenges. This technology supports regulatory compliance and improves worker and community health outcomes. Beyond construction sites, this technology opens opportunities for broader adoption in industrial settings, smart cities, and disaster response scenarios where air quality management is critical. The system\u2019s integration with real-time data monitoring provides valuable insights for policymakers, environmental agencies, and researchers studying urban pollution dynamics. This technology not only aligns with corporate environmental compliance but also presents new revenue streams through byproduct utilization (e.g., potassium carbonate) and service-based deployment models.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a novel chemical absorption process and high-surface-area packing materials to maximize pollutant capture while maintaining ultra-low energy consumption. This system integrates sensor-based monitoring and automated fan speed optimization to adapt to environmental conditions, enhancing efficiency in high-wind and variable-exposure environments. Through rigorous prototyping and field validation, the technology has demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating air pollution in urban and industrial settings, particularly at construction sites where emissions contribute significantly to local air quality degradation. The system\u2019s modularity allows for scalable deployment across diverse environments, from small-scale pilot studies to large-scale industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
