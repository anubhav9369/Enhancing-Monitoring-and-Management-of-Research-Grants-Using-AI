 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most important events for the international reaction engineering scientific community have historically been the North American/International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering. The 5th North American Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering (NASCRE-5) takes place February 16-19, 2025, in Houston, TX. This symposium provides a focus on the frontiers of chemical reaction engineering related to sustainability, with an opportunity for international networking within the scientific community. These meetings are held biennially, rotating between North America, Europe, and Asia. This international reputation, combined with the efforts of the organizing and scientific committees, ensures participants from different sub-disciplines, engage and learn about the practical technological challenges facing companies that apply chemical reaction engineering expertise. Support from the National Science Foundation will be utilized to support the travel of early-career faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe NASCRE-5 technical program is focused on emphasizing various sub-disciplines of chemical reaction engineering. The Scientific Committee comprises twenty seven leading academic and industrial researchers in sustainable chemical engineering from around the world. Technical Sessions cover emerging sustainable engineering focus areas such as CO2 Capture & Utilization, Reaction Engineering for Energy Transition, Polymer Upcycling, Novel Reactors and Process Intensification, and Automation/Digitization in Reaction Engineering. A combination of more than 90 oral presentations give students and early career researchers a forum for sharing their work and expertise. Technical Workshops will offer students the ability to learn additional practical skills such as Laboratory Reaction Engineering (taught by industrial experts) and Professional Development (taught by Chief Scientists and Leaders at Fortune 500 companies). The NSF funds will subsidize expenses such as registration, travel, and hotel accommodations for students, postdocs, and early career researchers. Supported attendees will be able to submit their research for publication in a special issue of Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
