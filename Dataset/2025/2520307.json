 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a leak detection solution for pressurized gas systems. This information is essential for industrial safety and efficiency, yet current methods are outdated and manual. These manual methods require time-consuming inspections by skilled personnel, rely on expensive equipment, and struggle to detect smaller leaks in complex or inaccessible systems. This solution is critical in reducing energy consumption, gas losses, and health risks. Potential customers include small and medium-sized industrial manufacturers and other industrial sectors that emphasize the use of high-pressure gas. Globally, gas leaks lead to significant energy waste and financial loss, with air leaks in U.S. facilities alone contributing an estimated $2.54 billion annually.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an advanced, integrated, real-time leak evaluation and detection system. The technology leverages advanced vibration-sensing algorithms and Industrial Internet of Things technologies to create a real-time gas leak detection solution that addresses inefficiencies in traditional manual methods. The system has the ability to continuously monitor gas lines using enabled sensors to deliver real-time feedback and precise alerts across a wide area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
