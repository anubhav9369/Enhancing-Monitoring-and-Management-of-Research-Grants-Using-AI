 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Shaping the Future Workforce for Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Semiconductor Manufacturing is hosted by the University of Texas at San Antonio. The program features research projects that the integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into robotics and semiconductor manufacturing and holds transformative potential for enhancing the capacity and efficiency of chip production in the United States.  Ten undergraduate students will be recruited from colleges across the nation. There is a shortage of students entering the workforce or graduate programs in these fields. REU students will receive direct mentorship from faculty and industry professionals, fostering a supportive and collaborative learning environment. The REU program also integrates research and education by offering training sessions, practical lab experiences, and opportunities for students to contribute to professional communities, such as judging robotic competitions and demonstrating research findings to peers and high school students. REU participants will also volunteer at professional conferences and host an annual REU conference. The program encourages participants to pursue graduate degrees in STEM disciplines, an essential step to strengthening the competitiveness of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this REU Site is to educate and train undergraduates, equipping them with a robust foundation and diverse skill sets in AI, robotics, and semiconductor manufacturing. The REU projects are designed to tackle frontier challenges through practical applications, such as assembling robotic systems, collecting and analyzing data using sensors in manufacturing lines, applying AI algorithms for data processing, and developing monitoring frameworks for semiconductor production. These activities provide novice researchers with valuable, hands-on experience. To further enhance student engagement and development, the program incorporates a learn-practice-service cycle into the research activities, while also fostering teamwork and building self-confidence through recognition and rewards. These elements enable participants to gain essential technical and professional skills, preparing them to make meaningful contributions to the field and pursue graduate studies and STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
