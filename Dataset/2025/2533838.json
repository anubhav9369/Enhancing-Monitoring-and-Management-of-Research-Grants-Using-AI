 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the convening of a workshop and extended mentoring opportunities and collaborations in the area of scientific proposal development.  The workshop enhances rigor in research design, scientific discovery, and scientific writing for the public with the goal of increasing opportunities for innovation for early-career scientists nationwide. Broader impacts of the research include enhancing scientific proposal writing curricula at institutions across the nation and contributing to supporting early career scientists in developing project ideas and project proposals in key areas of social and behavioral science. It specifically supports the development of novel project ideas with translational impact in all of NSF\u2019s scientific priority areas. The workshop and related mentoring activities expand the development of an innovative social scientific workforce for a variety of sectors in the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThe workshop involves participants from a wide range of scientific disciplines to enhance opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborative exchange and to generate and share best practices in scientific discovery and pluralistic engagement in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
