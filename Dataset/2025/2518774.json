 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing engineering curriculum to improve learning and graduation rates for all engineering students, especially students with fragmented time. Students\u2019 fragmented study time is often due to commuting, working, and managing family responsibilities. These often time-consuming and time-interrupting tasks can negatively impact students\u2019 academic success and graduation, contributing to a national shortfall of well-prepared STEM professionals. This Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project aims to help all students by creating engaging video- and inquiry-based homework activities that make learning engineering concepts easier and more flexible. Further, this project plans to advance our understanding of engaging engineering curricula and methodologies to best support student learning. Enhancing engineering curriculum, boosting student success, and investigating conditions under which improved student learning occurs are important in training well-prepared engineering professionals that will serve national interests. \r\n\r\nThe project team plans to fulfill three aims: Aim 1: To develop conceptual questions and homework modules of mechanical engineering courses with machine learning assistance. Aim 2: To implement the developed homework modules in the same mechanical engineering and evaluate the effectiveness of the homework modules. Aim 3: To modify the assessment module based on students\u2019 feedback, implement the (modified) assessments, and analyze collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the homework module affecting mechanical engineering course learning. The plan is to assess and disseminate immediate findings to peers, scientific communities, and the public through websites, workshops, publications, conferences, and social media platforms to broaden the impact of the project. The project is part of a long-term effort to establish innovative and sustainable pedagogies and curriculum improvement to boost students\u2019 retention and graduation rates. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
