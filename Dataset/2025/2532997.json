 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis project supports research that contributes new knowledge for scaling down future electronic devices. As the technologies inside smartphones and sensors become more compact and complex, managing the flow of electricity in devices becomes increasingly difficult. One of the most important basic materials in these devices is the dielectric, which is a thin insulating layer that helps control electrical signals. Creating uniform and defect-free dielectrics using conventional processing methods, especially materials that are only a few atoms thick, remains a major challenge. Alternative methods to address this are in high demand for modern computing, communications, sensing and other advanced technologies. This project investigates a method that turns certain thin materials into effective dielectric layers using a carefully controlled oxidation process. This produces layers that are smooth and nearly defect-free, making them a promising alternative for the next generation of electronic components, including computer chips, memory devices, and advanced sensors. Additionally, the project provides students hands-on experience with advanced tools and materials. Students help build and test devices, collect data on electrical properties, and participate in developing laboratory experiments. These experiences are helping to prepare them for science and engineering careers. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThe project develops a process-driven approach for making ultrathin dielectric layers by using two-dimensional layered materials. The goal is to provide an alternative to conventional deposition methods by converting selected two-dimensional materials into functional dielectrics through controlled oxidation. This strategy addresses the challenges of making atomically flat and low-defect dielectric films. First, the project investigates how transformation conditions influence key characteristics of the resulting films, including thickness, uniformity, and interfacial properties. Then, the project uses these films to fabricate basic electronic devices to evaluate their electrical characteristics and stability. These experiments help clarify the relationships among material origin, process parameters, and functional performance in nanoscale device applications. Finally, the project incorporates selected high-k dielectric layers into prototype device structures to determine their feasibility for advanced quantum applications. At the successful completion of this project, the results will establish a framework for forming ultrathin dielectric films directly from two-dimensional layered materials, supporting future technologies in low-power and quantum electronics. In parallel, these research activities are incorporated into academic courses and research training activities to support experiential learning in advanced electronic materials and device fabrication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
