 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop is planned to promote research data management (RDM) in the construction research community. The construction industry is experiencing an array of challenges including low productivity, issues in safety performance, and shortage of skilled workforce. To address these challenges, the construction research community has put much effort into integrating automation technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) to support infrastructure management, on-site safety control, and structure health monitoring. \r\n\r\nThrough collaboration between construction engineering and cyberinfrastructure experts, this project team will organize and hold a two-day workshop in May 2026 at the Michigan Tech University campus to identify challenges and opportunities of RDM in the construction research community. The workshop will invite leading scholars from government, industry and academia, including early-career researchers, and journal editors from construction engineering, open science, and cyberinfrastructure venues. The workshop facilitates the digital transformation of the construction industry by building the scientific connection between construction and open science communities, which will support construction community involvement and contribute to the Nation\u2019s cyberinfrastructure ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
