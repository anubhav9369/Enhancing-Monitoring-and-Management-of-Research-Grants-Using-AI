 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the FAA, the number of commercial drones in the US grew from 42,000 units to almost 400,000 in 2023, and in late 2023 over 850,000 drones had been registered. Forecasts suggest an increase of over $44B in the commercial drone market by 2027. As a result, the need for Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) pilots has been significantly increasing across a variety of industries as drone use is becoming mainstream. The goal of this project is to develop a degree program in UAS that will provide the academic and technical skills necessary for students to become certified UAS pilots. The program will leverage industry partnerships, integrate critical skillsets, knowledge, and proficiency with industry-standard hardware resulting in the production of students capable of addressing a critical workforce need in the central Oklahoma region.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on four major objectives: 1) Addressing need for licensed/certified UAS pilots; 2) Expanding curricular offerings to include a full degree program in Uncrewed and Autonomous Aircraft Systems; 3) providing professional development to program faculty; and 4) acquisition and training in the use of industry-standards hardware and software applications.  The project will provide workforce-ready employees, provide a perception shift from drones as a toy to drones as a tool, and contribute to efficiency and sustainability efforts. Key deliverables will include approximately 30 credit hours of course content in the major domain to be coupled with more traditional general education requirements. Evaluation activities conducted throughout the life of the project will ensure the quality of the program and will lead to a better understanding of how to achieve the desired outcomes of the project. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
