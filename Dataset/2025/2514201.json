 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNO-G is a research project that looks for radio signals created by neutrinos when they interact with polar ice. It is the first ultra-high energy neutrino observatory that can observe the Northern sky. This grant will allow the project to expand by adding new modular stations, with the aim of doubling its current level of sensitivity to these particles. The funding will support the building of antennas and systems to collect data. To set up each new station, researchers will drill three deep holes and install equipment that can work on its own. Enhancements to the experiment will ensure it can achieve its intended sensitivity and function for ten years after the array is finished. During this time, it will gather reliable data that will be shared with the wider community studying multimessenger astrophysics.\r\n\r\nNeutrinos can probe extreme conditions in astrophysical objects throughout the universe. This award will expand the currently operating Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) which can observe neutrinos in a new energy scale. When combined with observations from other messengers like photons, cosmic rays, and gravitational waves, observations of neutrinos made with RNO-G can further advance our understanding of the most powerful cosmic ray accelerators and explosive events in the universe. \r\n\r\nThis award will introduce the general public and students to particle astrophysics through workshops, research opportunities, and outreach events and provide infrastructure and engineering opportunities in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
