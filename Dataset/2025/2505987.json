 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern scientific challenges\u2014from predicting complex fluid flows to modeling plasma behavior in fusion reactors\u2014demand computationally efficient, trustworthy surrogates that can rival traditional numerical solvers while harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. Scientific machine learning (SciML), identified as a core technology for AI, offers immense potential for surrogate modeling in both data\u2011rich and data\u2011scarce situations; of particular interest is the field of operator learning. However, current operator learning frameworks lack unified theoretical foundations, robustness guarantees, and scalable training methods, which limit their adoption in high-stakes applications. The Unified Neural Operator (UNO) considered in this project will fill this gap by embedding all operator learning techniques into a unifying framework, marrying the mathematical rigor of traditional methods with the expressivity of modern AI. By delivering certifiable, interpretable AI\u2011driven surrogates, UNO advances Presidential priorities in artificial intelligence and nuclear energy\u2014supporting both next\u2011generation AI capabilities and efficient modeling of magnetohydrodynamic systems critical for fusion energy\u2014while fulfilling NSF\u2019s mission \u201cto promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense\u201d\r\n\r\nWithin SciML, operator learning has shown tremendous potential as a powerful tool for creating surrogate models, leading to a bevy of deep machine learning (ML)-based operator learning techniques known as \u201cneural operators\u201d. However, poorly-understood robustness characteristics, lack of explainability and interpretability, and the sheer variety of such approaches make it challenging for practitioners to choose the appropriate methods for different tasks, especially in the context of scientific applications. This project tackles these urgent challenges through the inception of a new computational framework: the Unified Neural Operator (UNO). UNO distills neural operators down into three essential components: an input encoder, a set of basis functions for the output space, and a projection operator. The work will (1) provide a mathematical formalism that both encompasses existing neural operators and allows us to generate novel architectures that target specific tasks and problems; (2) provide algorithms for scalable and adaptive training and inference, allowing UNO to adapt to local solution features and to tackle high-dimensional data efficiently in data-rich regimes; (3) provide a robust theoretical foundation in the form of universal approximation theorems, error estimates, and a guiding theoretical framework for robust sampling and adaptivity. The UNO framework also allows for automatic and natural uncertainty quantification capabilities of existing and new neural operators. In data-poor situations, the UNO framework preserves accuracy by analytically preserving physics, thereby making it well-suited to both in situ and ex situ surrogate modeling in scientific applications. The challenging applications targeted by this project include turbulent, multiscale, and multiphysics fluid flow problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
