 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project provides a fellowship to an Assistant professor at Dakota State University (DSU) and training for an undergraduate student. This work is conducted in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Southern California (USC). The PI will develop a novel approach for determination of few-quantum-particle interactions and scattering amplitudes in quantum computer simulations. Few-particle interaction and scattering dynamics play a key role in many areas of modern physics ranging from nuclear reactions in nuclear physics and astrophysics to electron-phonon scattering in material sciences. Performing accurate simulation of scattering experiments of strongly coupled quantum systems remains a challenging problem. Quantum computers have emerged as a promising alternative to simulate quantum systems efficiently and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations in classical simulation. Support from the fellowship will facilitate a wide range of quantum computing research, education and workforce-building activities. Additionally, project outcomes include fostering community engagement to promote collaborations across a broader range of Quantum Information Science and Technology. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the establishment of a novel approach to the study of few-particle interaction on quantum computers, which may have the potential to overcome the limitations in classical simulations. The novelty of the approach is to compute the integrated correlation functions of the few-body systems in an artificial trap, and the scattering phase shifts in infinite volume can be established through the difference of integrated correlation functions of interacting and non-interacting particles in the trap through a weighted integral by an exponential factor. Support from this project will improve the competitiveness of the PI\u2019s new research direction and establish new collaborations in the emerging field of quantum computing. Collaboration with the host sites will have long lasting impacts on quantum computing programs at DSU and the South Dakota Center for Quantum Information Science & Technology (C-QIST). South Dakota envisions that South Dakota C-QIST will establish itself as a hub for new research, collaborations and education of future workforce in the quantum computing field, which is expected to create new jobs and business opportunities, attract global talent, and lead to widespread investment. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Fellows, which supports early- and mid-career investigators in eligible jurisdictions to develop collaborations at the nation\u2019s private, government or academic research institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
