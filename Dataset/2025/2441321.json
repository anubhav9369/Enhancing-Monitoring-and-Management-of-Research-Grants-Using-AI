 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project studies the science of risk-taking. The PI specifically tests for the variables that impact decision-making in adolescence and young adulthood regarding their risks of injury, especially concussion and brain trauma. The research develops a data driven framework of how young people assess risk of brain injury and how that impacts their behavior and future goals. The broader impacts of the research involve collaborations with local and national agencies working towards mitigation of injuries and the implementation of safety measures. The integrated educational plan involves the establishment of a public-facing social science lab to train undergraduates in anthropological science and public health. The research will also inform the development of a new curriculum to train students and the public on the science of risk, injury, and medicine. \r\n\r\nIn order to investigate the relationship between injuries and the science of risk among youth, the PI conducts qualitative research in both educational and clinical settings. The project utilizes a longitudinal research design that follows one cohort of youth over four years. The research includes a mix of qualitative research methods including life histories and clinical tracking of brain trauma. Research findings and broader impacts advance scholarship in the science of risk and decision-making, medical anthropology, and public health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
