 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Level 2 Engaged Student Learning IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) project aims to serve the national interest by improving STEM students' engagement in science through the linkage of academic experiences with real-world problems that students will investigate in their mathematics, social science, and environmental classes.  Participatory science, also known as citizen science, engages the public in the scientific process by having individuals assist with data collection, data interpretation, and research question formation. This type of science has demonstrated its ability to advance scientific knowledge while also connecting the public to various biological and community issues and concerns. The significance of this when considering the university campus communities of this collaborative project is that participatory science activities can also increase undergraduate student engagement in STEM classes. Recent research also suggests that these efforts may have broader impacts on students' overall educational experiences in college, which is an additional goal. This project will scaffold activities that move students from simply learning basic scientific concepts to applying best scientific practices, and then to evaluating and using qualitative and quantitative results to inform student recommendations for resolving a local problem they are investigating. As these community-based projects are incorporated into course curricula, the impact will be seen in the improvement of student performance in STEM classes and an increase in the number of students interested in STEM careers. This is often the result of helping students see the link between academic experiences and real world problems and how the scientific process can be used to study these issues. \r\n\r\nThis project's overall goal is to enhance student learning outcomes in mathematics and data analytics through participatory science experiences. The Undergraduate Participatory Science Initiative (UPSI) in Data Analytics and Interdisciplinary StudY (DAISY) will consist of a scaffolded sequence of learning modules and research experiences grounded in participatory science, that will be available to students in general education mathematics courses and select courses in the social and environmental sciences. By integrating participatory science in the classroom, the project's scope of work will:  1) create an alternative research curriculum across disciplines; 2) train faculty across disciplines in utilizing participatory science in classroom; 3) provide students with engaging, community-based research training and leadership skills; and 4) improve environmental and student outcomes on campus and aid local communities through scientific research. The project will also involve a rigorous assessment of these experiences regarding enhancement of course-specific learning outcomes, as well as the extent to which they positively impact students' interest, self-efficacy, and connection to mathematics, science, and students' disciplinary major. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
