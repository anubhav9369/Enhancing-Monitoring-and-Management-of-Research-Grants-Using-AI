 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will expand access to experiential learning pathways in microelectronics and semiconductors through the implementation of the Central to Exploring Microelectronics Technologies Hub, a community-anchored initiative connecting New Britain and Hartford, Connecticut. In response to the U.S. semiconductor industry\u2019s projected shortfall of approximately 400,000 workers by 2030, the multi-pronged project will deploy three interlinked experiential learning programs aimed at increasing public engagement, education, and workforce preparation in the microelectronics and semiconductor sectors. It strategically integrates educational programming, hands-on experiences, and career development to meet workforce demands. The project involves the collaborative design and implementation of the three key programs: a Microelectronics and Semiconductor Exhibition, Microelectronics and Semiconductor Career Exploration Academy and a Microelectronics and Semiconductor Pre-Apprenticeship Career Training. These efforts are facilitated through the CEM Tech Alliance, a partnership network involving educators, faculty, community stakeholders, and industry leaders. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in the construction and launch of a modular, interactive exhibition hosted at the Connecticut Science Center. The exhibition will use digital interfaces, tactile displays, and simulations to demonstrate core semiconductor concepts such as wafer fabrication, photolithography, and logic circuitry. Community Engagement and Experiential Learning Scholars (who will be referred to as semi-CEELS), will be trained on delivering certified learning modules and curriculum at the Semiconductor Career Exploration Academies. Materials and activities will be reviewed by CEM Tech Alliance members, educators and industry leaders to ensure relevance and alignment with current sector needs.  The Semiconductor Career Exploration Academy learning modules will offer options for both in-person and virtual, learning covering semiconductor fundamentals, workforce roles, and careers in emerging technologies.  The pre-Apprenticeship Career Training will offer competency-based apprenticeship type training focused on technical and soft skills essential for entry-level semiconductor positions, including cleanroom protocols, electronics assembly, and quality assurance. Expected outcomes include: a sustained exhibition with up to 75,000 visitors reached at the end of the project that will provide awareness of semiconductor technology and careers and ways to express or continue interest in semiconductors. We expect more than 500 individuals to complete career exploration activities led by semi-CEELS through the career academies; and over 100 individuals to enroll in our pre-Apprenticeship Career Training programs. This will provide participants with targeted pathways to stackable certificates, entry level positions, advanced training, higher education and/or employment. Through the CEM Tech Alliance, the project will engage a wide range of community partners in providing the deliverables. The project will directly build a local talent pipeline and increasing public awareness and understanding of semiconductor innovation and its significance to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
