 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop technology to transmit wireless power and data through the subsurface. This technology will enhance subsurface characterization, a critical capability for industries advancing U.S. electrification, such as geothermal power and mining. Contemporary wireless power and communication techniques perform poorly underground, making it challenging to deploy autonomous subsurface devices. Additionally, changing or charging batteries at depth remains a significant challenge. The subsurface characterization market is valued at approximately $8 billion domestically and $14 billion globally per year, with projections reaching $25 billion worldwide within the next decade. Beyond the primary application, this wireless technology could transform multiple industries, including power transmission. The technology could expand electricity access and enhance U.S. energy security by significantly reducing power infrastructure costs. The underground design further enhances resilience, protecting against damage from disasters and wildfires. This innovation also bridges electrical engineering and geophysics, laying the foundation for future breakthroughs in the field.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative approach to transmitting wireless power and data through the ground. The core innovation diverges from contemporary long-range wireless power solutions that rely on electromagnetic space-wave techniques through the air. The primary research objectives are to develop numerical models, conduct field testing, and perform environmental and safety studies. This research will involve scaling and testing the functional prototype, focusing on improving transmitter and receiver designs. Additionally, the research will focus on reducing surface voltage and assessing building and environmental safety. The anticipated technical results include field demonstrations that significantly scale the system\u2019s capacity and a structured plan for safe scaling. This project is expected to advance the field of underground wireless power transfer and communications, providing a robust solution for subsurface characterization and potential uses in a host of other applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
