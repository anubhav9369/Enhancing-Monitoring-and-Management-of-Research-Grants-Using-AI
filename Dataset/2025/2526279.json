 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future applications of quantum technologies include secure communication, reliable navigation, and the solution of hard computational problems which impact the development of new medicines and our understanding of fundamental science, in addition to novel applications yet to be discovered. Achieving these applications is in reach but requires solving hard scientific and engineering problems, for which we need bright minds. Thus, building a quantum workforce is essential to unlock these scientific and societal benefits. This project will provide high school students experiential learning in quantum technologies to achieve this goal in a three-day summer camp to learn about computing and to solve quantum computing challenges.\r\n\r\nThis project provides high school students experiential learning in quantum technologies through a three-day summer camp. The camp's quantum curriculum was designed based on eight years of experience in teaching quantum information sciences across audiences, and will teach high school students about computing and how to solve quantum computing challenges. Having completed high school basic algebra and trigonometry, students will be taught the fundamentals of quantum technology through a series of hands-on activities. Students first learn about fundamentals of computing around information and bits and manipulating bits via the NAND game. They then engage in activities with polarizing filters to learn about quantum information and quantum bits (qubits). Students will use a computer program to prepare a qubit and learn how to measure its state and then use Bloch sphere to manipulate them as they explore logic gates. Students will also tour a quantum computer laboratory and talk with individuals working in industry about their career pathways. In addition to being introduced to quantum computing, we connect students to resources to help them apply to college. Our evaluation plan examines what students learned and whether they achieved the goal of programing a quantum computer and their interest in quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
