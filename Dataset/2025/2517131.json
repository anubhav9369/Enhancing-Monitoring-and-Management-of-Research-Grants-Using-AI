 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, led by BSCS Science Learning with partners NatureBridge and the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE), will conduct a research synthesis study to understand the extent, range, and nature of existing literature outdoor and nature-based environmental education programs, including the impacts of outdoor environmental program designs, professional learning, and pedagogical practices on educators and youth participant outcomes over a thirty-year period (1994-2024), and highlighting the role of climate-related emotions. The research will be broadly disseminated and communicated in multiple formats tailored to reach the many value holders of environmental education programs: outdoor educators, practitioners, researchers, scientists, leaders or policy makers and the general public.\r\n\r\nThis research synthesis study will provide new evidence and knowledge of the relationships among outdoor and nature-based environmental education programs, program design, pedagogical practices, and climate-related emotions of educators and youth participants. Using climate hopefulness as a guiding concept, the research synthesis will review published articles and literature across multiple fields related to environmental education over a thirty-year period. The contributions will be identification of gaps in current research, theories of change, critical insights and leverage points where informal STEM and outdoor environmental educational programs have had an influence, and impacts on current theories and practices addressed in educator professional learning and program designs. The research will also potentially contribute a descriptive model of the individual or internal factors, such as knowledge, attitudes, values, and emotions, and external factors, such as program interventions, educational activities, community project, that affect learning and engagement in outdoor and nature-based environmental education. The findings from this research synthesis will inform practices for nature-based environmental education programs and professional and a wider range of pedagogies to prepare educators and reach youth program participants.\r\n\r\nThis Synthesis project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing everyone multiple pathways for accessing and engaging in STEM learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
