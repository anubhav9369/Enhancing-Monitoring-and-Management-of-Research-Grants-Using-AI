 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Track 4 project aims to serve the national need of improving STEM teacher retention and effectiveness in high-need school districts (HNSDs) by fostering a collaborative Community of Practice (CoP) among multiple institutions. The initiative addresses persistent challenges in recruiting, preparing, and retaining secondary STEM teachers in HNSDs by leveraging a network of teacher preparation programs across the United States. Through a combination of data-driven research and community engagement, this project will systematically study factors influencing teacher persistence and effectiveness while developing strategies to enhance STEM teacher preparation. The project includes large-scale data collection, quantitative and qualitative analysis of teacher experiences, and dissemination of findings to refine teacher education practices. By promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing, the project has the potential to improve STEM education for all students and strengthen the STEM teacher workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project at a consortium of universities, including Alabama A&M University, Central Washington University, Middle Tennessee State University, North Dakota State University, University of Colorado Colorado Springs, University of Houston, University of Nevada-Reno, University of Texas at Austin, and University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, is designed to investigate and enhance STEM teacher persistence and effectiveness in HNSDs. Key project goals include analyzing the impact of STEM teacher preparation programs on teacher retention, identifying programmatic features that contribute to long-term effectiveness, and evaluating early career STEM teachers using the nationally normed Tripod student perception survey as well as a classroom observation protocol. Using a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach, the project will integrate quantitative analysis of STEM teacher placement and retention trends with qualitative interviews and focus groups. Findings will contribute to understanding the key elements of effective STEM teacher preparation and inform evidence-based practices for recruiting and supporting teachers in high-need schools. The CoP framework will facilitate knowledge exchange and professional development among teacher educators, fostering a common vision of effective STEM teaching. Evaluation efforts will track the impact of the CoP on teacher preparation programs and retention rates, ensuring sustainability and broad dissemination of results. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals in becoming effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced teachers in becoming STEM master educators in HNSDs. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in these districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
