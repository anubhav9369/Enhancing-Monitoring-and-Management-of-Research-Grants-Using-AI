 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of the spatial clustering of matter in the universe can reveal clues about the nature of the mysterious \u201cdark energy\u201d that is causing the universe\u2019s expansion to accelerate. A new powerful way to measure this clustering at early epochs in the universe\u2019s history is to use radio telescopes to detect the hydrogen gas that is ubiquitous in all galaxies. A team of scientists from Arizona State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University, and West Virginia University, is using a custom-built radio telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), to make one of the first measurements of dark energy from observations of radio waves emitted by hydrogen in the universe. This project will develop several new techniques to leverage the latest developments in signal processing, detector technology, and theoretical modeling. In parallel, this project will expand several outreach programs that teach high school and college-aged students about astronomy and scientific thinking.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to solve critical calibration and analysis challenges for CHIME that will reduce residual foreground contamination by an order of magnitude and enable the detection of the large-scale structure of the universe with the 21cm line, independent of other probes. CHIME\u2019s recent measurements of cross-correlations between 21cm intensity maps and eBOSS galaxies up to redshift 1.4, and the Lyman-alpha forest up to redshift 2.3, have demonstrated CHIME\u2019s potential for high-precision large-scale structure measurements. In this project, the team will develop new modeling frameworks and analysis pipelines for 21cm cross-correlations; generate improved beam models and integrate them into the analysis; implement new radio-frequency interference excision algorithms based on cyclostationary signal processing; and deploy innovative foreground filtering techniques that are robust to the dominant systematic errors in the data. These advances should lead to a CHIME-only auto-correlation detection of large-scale structure and ultimately the baryon acoustic oscillation signal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
