 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by helping students gain the knowledge and skills needed for the growing cloud computing industry, particularly in an economic region characterized by low educational attainment and generational poverty. West Virginia University at Parkersburg (WVUP) is leveraging a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and membership in the AWS Tech Alliance in West Virginia to implement a sector-based approach to technological education. The goal is to align curriculum, career pathways and resources with available jobs and careers in cloud computing. WVUP is supporting the project's infrastructure by housing the cloud computing program at a new WVUP Innovation and Technology Center, which will offer a cutting-edge training facility. \r\n\r\nWVUP will create a new cloud computing Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree pathway to meet the growing demand for computing technician jobs. A Certificate of Applied Science in Cloud Computing will be embedded with the AAS degree pathway to enable dual enrollment and traditional college students to gain and demonstrate competency in cloud computing processes. WVUP faculty will develop curriculum for the AAS degree and Certificate with resources available through the unique relationship with AWS. WVUP will emphasize recruitment of all students, including dual enrollment and nontraditional students, and provide student support infrastructure to promote successful completion of the program. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
