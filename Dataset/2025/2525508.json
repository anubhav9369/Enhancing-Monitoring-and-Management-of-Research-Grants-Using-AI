 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Implementation and Evaluation Project aims to transform mathematics education by embedding computation, programming, and data science into foundational and advanced undergraduate courses. The project will build a seamless pathway from Pasadena City College (PCC) to California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) for students pursuing careers in data science and AI-related fields. This work is important because students often lack access to courses that integrate modern computational tools into math curricula. By making these skills accessible early in the academic journey, the project will prepare students to thrive in high-demand, data-driven careers and help close achievement gaps in STEM. The project expects to support transfer preparation, enhance student engagement and retention in the data science workforce by offering computation-enriched courses, creating a new Data Science option at Cal State LA, and building student-industry-faculty research collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe project team will develop and implement a series of lower-division courses at PCC, such as Calculus I and II with programming, Linear Algebra with Python, and Statistical Programming\u2014as well as upper-division courses at Cal State LA, including Foundations of Mathematics for Data Science, a Capstone Course, and a revised Mathematical Statistics course. A new introductory course in scientific computing will support articulation between the two institutions. The curriculum will emphasize applied problem-solving, computational modeling, and ethical data analysis. Evaluation will include both formative and summative assessments to measure curriculum effectiveness, faculty development outcomes, and student learning. All instructional materials will be made available as Open Educational Resources (OERs), and dissemination will include student research presentations and industry engagement. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
