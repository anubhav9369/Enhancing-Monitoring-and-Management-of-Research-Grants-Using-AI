 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs to acquire a MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometer (MS) to support the research of Professors Scott Poh, Sven Eklund, Gergana Nestorova, Elisa Castagnola, Shaurav Alam and Shengnian Wang at Louisiana Tech University. This instrument facilitates teaching and research in the areas of biochemistry, molecular biology, engineering, and polymer research, thus fostering interdisciplinary collaboration among its faculty, students, and partner institutions. This multi-user instrument is expected to benefit 8 research groups and 3 teaching labs, providing hands-on learning opportunities in advanced analytical techniques. Furthermore, integration of this technology into the academic curriculum prepares students for competitive careers in engineering, biotechnology, pharmaceutical research, and analytical chemistry, enhancing their employability in a rapidly evolving job market.\r\n\r\nThis award for acquiring a MALDI-ToF MS instrument allows for the detailed analysis of a wide range of macromolecules, including polymers, peptides/proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. This award strengthens the research infrastructure of the university and region, to benefit a wide range of multidisciplinary research and will enable innovative research into peptidomimetics, lipidomic, geopolymer and proteomics, pushing the boundaries of current knowledge in these fields. Some of the research projects supported by this project include (1) comprehensive bioactive peptide profiling and optimization by offering high-sensitivity detection, improved structural analysis, and high-throughput screening capabilities; (2) elucidating polymer evolution and stability in geopolymer composites by determining polymerization extent and chain length distribution, thereby generating fundamental insights into the complex relationships among composition, processing, microstructure, performance, and structural integrity of geopolymer; (3) development of analytical framework for detection and characterization of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived proteomic and lipidomic signatures. This instrument offers high sensitivity and allows for cutting-edge characterization of EV-derived proteomic cargo and lipid composition for biomarker discovery and understanding of their function; (4) detection of highly sensitive neurotransmitters, which can be particularly useful for measuring multiple neurotransmitters over varying timescales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
