 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will realize nanoscale amplifier devices tailored for the rapidly advancing quantum technology. These amplifiers will work in the microwave frequency range where quantum devices are typically operated. Quantum parametric amplifiers are prominently featured in applications such as quantum-limited detection, as well as coupling of distant quantum circuits.  The amplifiers will be built out of a combination of superconductor and semiconductor materials and will use nanowires as their core elements. The project will improve the nanowire growth to attain defect-free, epitaxial growth which is believed to directly translate into the performance of quantum devices. The amplifiers will be compatible with large magnetic fields which will open their use in several quantum technologies such as quantum dot spin qubits and prospective topological qubits.\r\n\r\nThis project will support a collaboration between researchers in the United States and France that will both explore and enhance the potential of nanowire-based devices for quantum information science. The project will design, create, and characterize nanowire-based quantum-limited nonlinear quantum circuits such as parametric amplifiers that leverage the unique features of the hybrid materials platform. The devices will offer unique operational advantages such as large gate-tunability exceeding 1 GHz, gains of up to 20 dB, dynamic bandwidth of order 40 MHz, and magnetic field compatibility up to 1 Tesla. The applications of these devices include pump-efficient quantum-limited amplification, as well as potential use in novel two-qubit gate schemes. Magnetic field compatibility offers opportunities for integration into spin qubit and future topological quantum computing platforms. Device design will be based on the unconventional Josephson effects such as non-inversion symmetric current-phase relations. Intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and large effective Land\u00e9 g-factors in InAs will be used to induce strong third-order nonlinearities in Josephson inductive elements, realizing in a single junction the equivalent of quantum circuits such as the Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
