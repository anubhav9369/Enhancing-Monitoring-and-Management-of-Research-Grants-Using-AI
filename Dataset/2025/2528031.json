 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project are to advance the development of compact and scalable laser technology that can enable more precise and energy-efficient systems for applications such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring and mapping, satellite communication, and biomedical devices. Current high-performance lasers are either bulky and expensive or small and underpowered, limiting their use in space-constrained platforms like drones and satellites. This project aims to address these limitations by developing a new class of chip-scale lasers that deliver high power, low-divergence beams while maintaining a small footprint. These lasers have the potential to reduce energy consumption, improve sensing capabilities, and lower the cost of deploying advanced optical technologies in both public and private sectors. The initial target market will focus on compact sensor systems, with long-term diversification opportunities in manufacturing, communication, surgery and diagnostics, and defense. This project will enable foundational demonstration of this laser technology which if successful, could result in a suite of next-generation lasers that will be optimized for specific applications across multiple commercial sectors.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a new laser architecture that allows single-mode operation to be maintained over large emission areas. The central innovation is a cavity design that produces a uniform optical field across the entire surface of the gain material, allowing power to scale with area without degrading beam quality. This enables the laser to emit narrow-divergence, high-coherence light even at watt-level power outputs from a compact, surface-emitting chip. The research will involve optimizing the photonic crystal structure, investigating material platforms for different wavelengths, and testing prototype devices for beam quality and power output. The project will also evaluate the thermal and structural performance of these devices when bonded to substrates suitable for heat dissipation and packaging. The expected outcome is a fully characterized prototype laser capable of room-temperature operation, high beam quality, and integration into sensing systems. This research addresses fundamental challenges in photonic design and has the potential to advance both commercial and scientific laser applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
