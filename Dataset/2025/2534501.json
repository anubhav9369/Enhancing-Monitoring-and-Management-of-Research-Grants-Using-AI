 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for U.S.-based individuals to participate in the conference Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras (YMC*A), to be held July 21 - 25, 2025 at Southern Denmark University in Odense, Denmark. This meeting is organized for and by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in operator algebras and related areas, with the goal of fostering scientific interaction among early-career researchers. The conference also includes a panel focused on advice to help early-career researchers navigate the career path of mathematics research. In each of its previous seven editions, YMC*A has provided an excellent opportunity for over one hundred early-career operator algebraists from around the world to attend mini-courses on current research topics in operator algebras. This grant significantly boosts the participation of U.S.-based researchers and their institutions at this conference, exemplifying and enhancing U.S. research and furnishing opportunities for researchers to expand their professional networks. More information about the conference is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/ymcstara-2025.\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on recent developments in operator algebras, noncommutative geometry, and related areas of mathematical analysis. The conference features three mini-courses by established researchers alongside many contributed research talks by participants, and mentoring activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
