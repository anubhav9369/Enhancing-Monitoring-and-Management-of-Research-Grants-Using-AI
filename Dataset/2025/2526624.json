 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) is a multi-national autonomous scientific institution conducting research on global challenges requiring multidisciplinary and multilateral collaborations. This project will support U.S. membership contributions to IIASA for the next 5 years. IIASA plans to deepen engagement with the U.S. scientific community by enhancing U.S. impact on IIASA governance, expanding research collaborations, increasing presence at key U.S. conferences, and offering additional capacity-building opportunities to U.S. researchers. IIASA is well-positioned to support U.S. efforts to remain at the forefront of science and innovation. Over the next five years, IIASA will support American global leadership in science by providing valuable training and collaboration opportunities for U.S. scientists. IIASA will continue to foster trust in science, and support requests for critical data and models from U.S. decision-makers and partners in the private sector to drive innovation. U.S. researchers benefit from IIASA\u2019s global network, strengthening their careers and expanding research impact.\r\n\r\nThe new IIASA research plan titled \"2025 and Beyond: A Vision for Global Collaboration and Innovation\u201d include such high priority items as Advancing Systems Analysis which builds on IIASA's legacy in operations research, optimization, and systems analysis, leveraging natural and social sciences, various data sources, machine learning, and engagement with policy to deliver impactful outcomes for stakeholders; and Economic Frontiers which has made strong contributions to global and local policy debates.,\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
