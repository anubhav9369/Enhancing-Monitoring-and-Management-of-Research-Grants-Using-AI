 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in making advanced light-based (optical) technologies more affordable and accessible by developing a new way to 3D-print tiny glass parts that control light. These parts, called micro-optics, are used in cameras, lasers, medical tools, communication systems, etc. Currently, making these components is slow, expensive, and requires putting together lots of small pieces. This project introduces a faster and easier method that can create complete light-controlling systems in one step. This could help more people and companies use high-quality optical technology, while also opening new possibilities in fields like telecommunications, healthcare, and self-driving vehicles. The new process costs less, works faster, and allows more creative designs, giving the company a strong advantage in a growing market.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to overcome key limitations in the fabrication of high-performance glass micro-optics by developing a high-throughput 3D printing system utilizing an advanced two-photon polymerization (TPP) technique. Traditional methods for producing glass optics are hindered by high complexity, limited scalability, and elevated costs, and are unable to fabricate monolithic optical systems with integrated functionality. The proposed work will develop a novel 3D printing platform capable of producing high-precision, high-contrast glass micro-optical elements at high throughput. The research objectives include optimizing printing parameters for high optical quality, calibrating TPP printing systems to achieve sub-micron accuracy and uniformity, and fabricating prototype micro-optical systems with integrated optical functions. The project will integrate advances in materials science, ultrafast laser processing, and precision motion control to establish a scalable and alignment-free manufacturing process for micro-optics. The anticipated technical outcome is the demonstration of a reliable fabrication method for complex, compact glass micro-optical systems with superior optical performance, reduced assembly requirements, and improved manufacturability. This research will lay the technical foundation for a disruptive manufacturing approach that enables the widespread adoption of high-performance micro-optics in photonics, medical imaging, and other advanced optical systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
