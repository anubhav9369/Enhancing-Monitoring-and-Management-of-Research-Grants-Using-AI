 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Purdue University, in West Lafayette, IN, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025-2027. A total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained, which will contribute to developing the US STEM workforce. This program will develop practical and intellectual research skills under the general theme of protein analysis. The program will prepare students to pursue, and be successful in, advanced STEM degrees and/or enter research careers in industry. Students will conduct cutting-edge, mentored, independent research in a Department of Biochemistry lab. They will engage in hypothesis-driven experimentation using diverse analytical methods covering biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, and molecular genetics, while developing valuable critical thinking and communication skills. The program culminates with a presentation of research results at a campus-wide symposium. Many students will further present their work at external scientific conferences. Assessment will be achieved with a pre/post Likert survey designed by the Purdue Center for Instructional Excellence. Students should apply using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov).\r\n\r\nAvailable projects in Department of Biochemistry labs cover a broad range of experimental approaches for protein characterization, including analytical chemistry (such as mass spectrometry), structural biology, enzyme kinetics, biophysics, molecular genetics, genomics (next-gen sequencing applications), microscopy and other cell biology methods. A variety of model organisms including yeast, fruit flies, and plants provide powerful and convenient systems to study protein function and regulation. Research is augmented with early learning modules and weekly group meetings covering fundamentals of protein structure and function, responsible conduct of research, lab safety, using primary literature, experimental design, research documentation, scientific communication, entrepreneurship, and preparation for graduate school. Participants will meet with biotech company representatives to discuss industry careers and hear from faculty about careers in academic research and teaching. Applications will be evaluated by a committee of faculty and staff, and selected using a holistic approach that includes academics, career interests, letters of recommendation, and personal statements. Participants will include rising juniors and seniors with demonstrated passion for experimental research and pursuing graduate degrees and careers in biochemistry- and molecular biology-related fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
