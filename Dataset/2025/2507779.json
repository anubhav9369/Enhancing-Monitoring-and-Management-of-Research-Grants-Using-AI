 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to reduce the environmental burden of electronic waste by enabling the recycling of materials used in flexible electronic devices. As demand for compact, disposable electronics in healthcare, packaging, and consumer products continues to rise, so does the volume of unrecyclable substrate materials, many of which are incinerated or landfilled. This project addresses this growing issue by developing new degradable materials that match the performance of conventional alternatives while enabling low-cost, scalable recycling of high-value electronic components. The innovation could support circular manufacturing practices and reduce dependence on overseas material supply chains. With consumers and major electronics manufacturers setting ambitious sustainability targets, this solution aligns with both regulatory and market trends. The first market segment targeted is suppliers of flexible circuit substrates, a segment projected to surpass $55 billion by 2031. This project\u2019s outcome has the potential to create a durable competitive advantage by enabling cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional nonrecyclable substrates. By year three of production, the technology could generate multi-million-dollar revenues while supporting U.S.-based manufacturing, enhancing supply chain resilience, and contributing to national efforts to reduce waste and promote sustainable materials innovation.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop recyclable, high-performance polymer substrates for flexible electronics using a novel photopolymerizable, degradable material platform. Traditional polyimides offer high thermal stability but are neither recyclable nor degradable under practical conditions, contributing significantly to electronic waste. This project addresses that limitation by synthesizing crosslinked, thermosetting polymers via photopolymerization using monomers containing degradable ester linkages. The project will focus on demonstrating key performance attributes\u2014thermal stability above 250 degrees Celsius, mechanical integrity, and dielectric properties\u2014while maintaining photoprocessability for single and multilayered circuit fabrication. The research objectives include developing cost-competitive formulations using existing chemical supply chains, optimizing photopolymerization parameters for manufacturing compatibility, and establishing mild chemical degradation conditions that allow recovery and reuse of functional components. The project will also explore the feasibility of closed-loop recycling by repolymerizing degraded materials and conducting a full life cycle assessment. Successful completion will establish a scalable method for producing flexible substrates with end-of-life recyclability, enabling both economic and environmental benefits. The anticipated technical results include the fabrication of flexible circuit demonstrators, validation of degradation protocols, and confirmation of key material performance metrics, supporting the commercial viability of the proposed platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
