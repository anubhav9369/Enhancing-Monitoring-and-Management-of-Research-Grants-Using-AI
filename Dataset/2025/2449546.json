 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference seeks to improve how teacher preparation programs equip educators to engage families in preK-5 children\u2019s math learning by bringing together math teacher educators, preK-5 classroom teachers, families/caregivers, and mathematics teacher candidates. The conference topic is important because while family engagement in mathematics is highly predictive of children\u2019s mathematical outcomes, teachers\u2019 family engagement responsibilities are rarely addressed in teacher preparation programs.  Beginning with an in-person gathering and followed by two virtual workshops, the conference will elevate models of community-engaged mathematics teacher preparation and explore the competencies that elementary grade teachers must develop to meaningfully engage families in mathematics. By highlighting the voices of families, pre- and in-service teachers and university faculty, the project ultimately seeks to strengthen family-school partnerships, foster success in math and STEM careers for all students, promote the progress of science, and support the nation\u2019s prosperity by fostering inclusive and equitable educational practices. The proposal is supported by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), an applied research program that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for funded projects.\r\n\r\nAcross the in-person and virtual convenings, the diverse group of participants will address four main research questions including: 1. What promising approaches and methods currently exist in the landscape of preparing mathematics teachers for family engagement? 2. What competencies do families, mathematics teacher educators, and mathematics teachers themselves believe are necessary for mathematics teachers to develop to engage families equitably and effectively in their children\u2019s mathematics education? 3. How can mathematics teacher educators best prepare mathematics teachers during coursework and clinical experience for their work with families and communities? 4. What are the key priorities and next steps that could inform a collaborative research project around the preparation of mathematics teachers for family and community engagement?  The conference also explores promising family engagement practices, identifies essential teacher competencies, and proposes next steps in advancing teacher preparation for family engagement in children\u2019s math learning, with special attention to elevating families\u2019 voices. Recordings and transcriptions of in-person and virtual sessions, post-event surveys, and other artifacts will be thematically analyzed. Expected outcomes include a framework for math teacher education and scholarly collaborations on the topic including future DRK-12 research proposals on the topic. A research-practice network and project webpage hosted by the Center for Family Math will afford future collaboration and dissemination opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
