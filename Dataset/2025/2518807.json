 "awd_abstract_narration": "From Alaska to Greenland, agriculture is expanding in many Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions.  Growing seasons in these areas have lengthened, allowing for more intensive farming practices and greater crop diversity. This northward shift presents opportunities for improved local food security. However, the potential long-term impacts of agricultural expansion to freshwater sources and ecosystems remain poorly understood. This project will investigate how farming practices and freshwater changes affect Arctic and Sub-Arctic ecosystems. This collaboration spans the United States and Greenland, addressing concerns of Arctic farmers and furthering international connections with the scientific community. The project will engage local Arctic farmers and will train multiple early career scholars, meeting the aims of 'translational research' in Arctic contexts.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine the interactions and feedbacks driving the dynamics of socio-terrestrial-aquatic systems within Sub-Arctic agroecosystems. The researchers will pursue interdisciplinary methods to understand freshwater responses to natural and agricultural activity, including studying water consumption, irrigation, and flow rates in partnership with six participating farms in South Greenland. Data on the hydrologic variability and nutrient levels will also be collected from six lakes and seven streams to capture representative freshwater systems of the area. These present-day data will be compared with paleolimnological reconstructions for the past 2,000 years to understand how these systems are changing over time. Remote sensing will be used to evaluate impacts on land surface hydrology from the local watershed to regional scale. These data will inform the impacts of expanding agriculture on Arctic and sub-Arctic water systems while informing potential future scenarios as agriculture continues to grow in the region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
