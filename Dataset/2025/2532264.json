 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a hemostatic wound care product capable of quickly stopping bleeding for a variety of traumatic and surgical wounds. This product is important for treating traumatic soldier injuries including those occurring on the battlefield. It also has numerous civilian applications for both common and severe wounds as well as surgical wounds. The product is in the form of a compressible, absorbent and insoluble foam composed of starch, chitosan and glycerol. This solution is completely bioabsorbable and as it absorbs blood and wound extrudates, it slowly transitions into an insoluble gel at the interface between the wound and foam. The biofoam\u2019s physical properties in conjunction with its bioabsorbability allows it to be removed from the wound site without disturbing a clot or healing tissue. The technology may have other applications in chronic wound care. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an insoluble hemostatic foam comprised of starch, chitosan and glycerol. Insolubility is achieved through the formation of a polysaccharide polyelectrolyte complex of anionic potato starch and cationic chitosan. Chitosan is a key component as it aggregates red blood cells and stimulates clotting. The foam is made soft through the incorporation of glycerol which acts as a plasticizer. The material is distinct from other products as it is stable, compressible, bioabsorbable, and hemostatic. The form can be made in many shapes and sizes, is simple to use, can be packaged compressed in a flat pack and stored for years without any special environmental requirements. The solution is a superior drop-in replacement for combat gauze and can be used for surface and intracavity wounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
