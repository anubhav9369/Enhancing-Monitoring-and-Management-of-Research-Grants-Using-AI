 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project investigates the factors that impact variability in STEM training programs across the nation. The investigators specifically measure the institutional factors that contribute to development of career-ready science curricula and how successful best practices can be leveraged for translational impact on workforce development for industry. The investigators also identify strategies for addressing curricular challenges with a goal of strengthening the STEM workforce. The broader impacts identify strategies for curricular and institutional change in STEM training programs that would support the workforce and career development of students and translate to leveraging partnerships between higher education and industry. The project has a significant training component in research methods and best practices in STEM translational research for students at the PI and Co-PI institutions. \r\n\r\nThe study sample represent a range of educational institutions across the nation. Interview, focus group, and behavioral data will be collected with stakeholders in STEM training and education, and with undergraduate and graduate students and alumni at each institution to understand the factors that impact the development of a career-ready STEM curriculum. The research is focused on measuring institutional change in STEM training and education, and the training and reskilling/upskilling of the STEM workforce for education and industry. Broader impacts leverage partnerships with various sectors to enable the translation of STEM education to other sectors of priority in the economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
