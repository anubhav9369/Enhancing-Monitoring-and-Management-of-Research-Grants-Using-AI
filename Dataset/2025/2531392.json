 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for participants in \u201cSemi-annual Workshop in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics at Penn State,\u201d to be held on the Penn State University Park campus November 13-16, 2025.  This represents the Penn State half of the Semi-annual Workshop in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics, cosponsored for the last 35 years by the dynamics groups of Penn State and University of Maryland; the Maryland half is held each spring. The workshop is devoted to recent developments in dynamical systems and many applications to related fields.  The goals of this conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results, to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and related fields, to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields, and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics community. \r\n\r\nThis conference series began as a meeting place for mathematicians based primarily in the northeastern United States working in dynamical systems and related topics, and during the past twenty years has grown to attract outstanding mathematicians from around the world.  In recent years the conference has featured several special sessions focused on the latest achievements and current research trends in dynamics and its applications.  The themes for the 2025 edition of the workshop include classification of measures for homogeneous and non-homogeneous systems, ergodic and mixing properties of parabolic flows and sharp bounds on their deviation of ergodic averages, new developments for random systems, recent trends in the theory of Hamiltonian dynamics, statistical properties of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems and their thermodynamic formalism. More information can be found on the conference website at https://science.psu.edu/math/research/dynsys/workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
