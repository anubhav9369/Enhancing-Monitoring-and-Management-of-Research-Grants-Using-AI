 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the translation from lab to market of a manufacturing solution to affordably produce acrylic fibers in the U.S. This solution addresses the current reliance on imported acrylic fibers, especially given their importance in manufacturing military, outdoor, and apparel applications. The commercialization of this solution has the potential to benefit the U.S. economy and society by introducing competitively priced acrylic fibers that are domestically made. The acrylic fiber market is worth $1 billion annually. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a more affordable method of manufacturing petroleum-based polyacrylonitrile (PAN) into specialty acrylic fibers and precursors to carbon fiber. The current process of spinning PAN-based fibers relies on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are flammable and toxic. This new solution consists of manufacturing PAN-based fibers by the process of melt spinning at high speed, offering a low energy approach to fiber manufacturing. The benefits of this approach include a reliable, domestic supply of acrylic fibers for U.S. textile fiber mills at a potentially lower cost.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
