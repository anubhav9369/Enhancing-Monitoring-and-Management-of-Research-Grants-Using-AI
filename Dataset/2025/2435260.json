 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geodesy is the science of measuring and understanding the Earth\u2019s shape and its orientation in space, as well as the changes of these properties with time. Seismology is the study of elastic waves in the Earth, the sources that generate such waves, and the Earth structure through which they travel. Combined, geodesy and seismology play critical roles in understanding the deformation of the Earth\u2019s surface and addressing questions about Earth\u2019s structure, evolution, and dynamics, including problems of significant societal relevance, such as natural hazards, resources, and national security.\r\n\u201cThe National Geophysical Facility: Advancing Earth Science Capabilities through Innovation\u201d award supports national geophysical resources for discoveries across Earth Science and advancing the science of geodesy and seismology. The facility will provide scientific instrumentation, data capabilities, and workforce development spanning many disciplines and applications, from earthquake physics to space weather.  By sharing sensors, data, and analysis tools across thousands of investigations, the national facility maximizes both operational efficiency and scientific advancement.  The capabilities of the facility are also being used beyond the research domain to monitor geophysical and nuclear threat detection, to advance forecasting and preparedness, and to provide economic development through technology transfer.\r\n\r\nThe National Geophysical Facility (NGF) will operate several functional components, including a large pool of advanced geophysical sensors of more than 40 different types, operation of persistent global and regional sensor networks delivering low-latency data, a cloud-native data repository with multiple points of access and data analysis services and products, and a range of outreach, training, and educational resources.  These components support research and technical development in Earth Science from the inner core to the outermost atmosphere.  Some novel research directions and applications enabled by facility advancement include artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to hazards and their cascading impacts, ocean-bottom capabilities in geodesy, integration of near-surface observations with solid-earth data, and novel platforms for independent and asynchronous technical training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
