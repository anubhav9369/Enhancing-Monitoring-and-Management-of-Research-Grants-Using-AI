 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this is a one-year planning grant that will allow Meharry Medical College to develop a proposal to establish an NSF CREST center focused on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven computational biology research. The proposed CREST center leverages Meharry's School of Applied Computational Sciences and its existing graduate programs in data science. The significance of this project is the planning of a university-based CREST center-focused research designed to advance computational biology research with AI, which will address complex problems in biological systems. This future CREST center is important to the nation as future discoveries with ethical underpinnings are at the forefront of science. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a proposal and sustainability plan for a CREST center to advance computational biology research with AI, addressing complex problems in biological systems. Our approach is to complete the following objectives: (1) engage in strategic planning for a CREST center proposal, (2) expand the partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to include the US Department of Energy's Frontiers in AI initiative, and (3) create an advisory board for the future CREST center. Completing these objectives will lay the groundwork for completing a successful CREST center proposal and sustainability plan. Meharry\u2019s proposed center will be built upon developing integrated research subprojects. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
