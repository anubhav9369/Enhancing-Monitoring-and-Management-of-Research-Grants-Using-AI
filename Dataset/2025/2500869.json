 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to strengthen the Smart Systems Technologies program at Finger Lakes Community College by expanding universal access to technical education through an innovative HyFlex model that integrates in-person, synchronous online, and asynchronous learning, which facilitates completion of required co-op experience. To better serve traditional students, incumbent workers and the underemployed, the project enables learners to pursue technical careers more easily without interrupting their income or employment. By embedding emerging Industry 4.0 technologies\u2014such as cyber physical systems, digital twins, augmented and virtual reality, and generative AI\u2014the project aims to improve remote interactivity and engagement. It promotes national workforce priorities by strengthening technical education pipelines, addressing labor shortages across advanced manufacturing sectors, and supporting the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in regional high-tech ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe project will scale HyFlex instruction across nine courses, supported by 20 modular learning units, two lab kits for remote students, and four remotely controlled laboratory environments simulating smart factory operations. Collaboration with regional businesses to provide paid co-op opportunities tailored to employer needs, supports high retention and job placement rates among students. The project will document outcomes through five case studies focused on employer-student collaboration in SMEs, and five case studies highlighting successful transitions for incumbent workers and underemployed baccalaureates and associates into technical careers. Additional project activities include the acquisition of smart manufacturing equipment and professional development workshops for high school educators. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
