 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for students enrolled at U.S. institutions to participate in the Doctoral Consortium at the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii. Now in its 20th year, ICCV is a premier international conference that convenes leading researchers and students working on computer vision, a foundational area of artificial intelligence (AI) with broad applications in fields such as healthcare, security, robotics, and autonomous systems. The Doctoral Consortium helps cultivate future leaders in AI and computer vision by providing early-career researchers with opportunities to engage in technical discourse, refine their research directions, and build professional networks. By enabling approximately 20 Ph.D. students from a diverse range of academic institutions to attend the Consortium, the award promotes access to mentorship, career development, and scholarly exchange. In doing so, this award directly supports the progress of science and the development of the U.S. scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThe award provides travel support for 20 students from US institutions to participate in a structured program held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. The Doctoral Consortium includes poster sessions, mentorship sessions with senior researchers, and focused discussions on career pathways in academia and industry. Student applicants will be evaluated by the Consortium chairs based on the quality and relevance of their research, their potential for leadership in the field, and the expected impact of their participation. The travel awards will help students cover key expenses such as airfare, lodging, and local transportation. By providing this support, the award ensures that promising young researchers can contribute to and benefit from one of the most influential venues in computer vision and artificial intelligence research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
