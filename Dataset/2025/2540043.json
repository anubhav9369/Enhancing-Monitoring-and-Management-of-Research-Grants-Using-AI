 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing demand for a motivated, well-trained STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce in emerging and advanced technology fields requires attracting and retaining a broad pool of talented students. NSF\u2019s ExLENT (Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies) initiative addresses this need by supporting programs that use experiential learning to introduce participants to real-world, problem-solving experiences that build both knowledge and practical skills. However, the education and workforce sectors often operate in isolation, with limited overlap, collaboration, or systems-level thinking to support such integrated workforce development. To help bridge this gap, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) will organize two national forums\u2014one in-person and one virtual\u2014bringing together ExLENT grantees, business and industry leaders, and experts in experiential learning. These forums will allow grantees to learn from each other\u2019s experiences, explore evidence-based strategies for supporting non-traditional learners, and build connections with potential employers in advanced engineering and technology sectors. The initiative will apply an \u201ceducation ecosystem\u201d approach, helping grantees recognize the broader landscape of organizations and policies that influence participants. By facilitating dialogue within the grantee community and between educators and employers, the NAE will promote collaboration and synergy across projects and sectors. \r\n\r\nThe two proposed forums will bring together ExLENT awardees, business and industry leaders, and experts in experiential learning to identify levers of change for workforce development in emerging technologies. The first forum will focus on evidence-based strategies, peer learning, and relationship building. Approximately four months later, the second, virtual forum will reunite participants, along with additional system partners, to reflect on their experiences, assess the systems-approach framework, exchange lessons learned, and provide feedback on the effectiveness of the convenings as a means of fostering collaborations. The forums will feature informative and interactive sessions that will include a mix of presentations, panel discussions, demonstrations, hands-on training, case studies, role-playing, small-group discussions, and networking opportunities. Topic-specific facilitators will enhance the quality and impact of these engagements. The proposal\u2019s theory of action is that applying systems engineering principles and outcomes\u2014proven effective in other domains\u2014can generate new insights that improve outcomes for ExLENT grantees. These forums may thus inspire participants to refine their projects based on shared knowledge and perspectives. The NAE will disseminate forum outcomes through selected videos, written summaries, publications in education and technical outlets, and other materials tailored for specific audiences.\r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
