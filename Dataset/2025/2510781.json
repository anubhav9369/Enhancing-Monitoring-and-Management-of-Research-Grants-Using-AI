 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tackles a significant environmental challenge by creating a scalable and cost-effective solution to minimize the use of single-use plastic packaging in the large home appliances sector. The project focuses on transitioning to reusable packaging systems at a leading manufacturing facility. The project aims to reduce plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining operational efficiency. By collaborating with an industry partner and supply chain logistics experts, the activity will design durable, eco-friendly packaging alternatives and test their real-world effectiveness performance. The anticipated outcome is a significant reduction in environmental impacts, including reduction of carbon emissions that are associated with plastic stretch wrap that are commonly used in shipping and logistics. In addition to environmental benefits, this effort will generate economic value, promote sustainable manufacturing practices, and support national goals toward circular economy adoption. This project will also provide training opportunities for students and early-career researchers through research engagement, internships, and hands-on education integrated into academia coursework.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop an integrated framework for evaluating the transition from single-use to reusable packaging systems for large home appliances. The project includes five coordinated components: (1) development of a mixed-integer programming model to optimize the number and allocation of reusable containers based on historical logistics data; (2) modular redesign of packaging solutions using eco-friendly and durable materials adaptable across multiple appliance types; (3) life cycle assessment to quantify the comparative environmental impact of reusable versus single-use systems; (4) synthesis of optimization, design, and life cycle assessment into an operational deployment strategy; and (5) implementation of a pilot study at a key refurbishment center in collaboration with logistics and manufacturing partners. This work advances the state of knowledge in sustainable supply chain management by integrating cost and inventory modeling with packaging design innovation and quantitative environmental evaluation. The results will provide a data-driven roadmap for evaluating industry-wide adoption of reusable systems and establish a foundation for broader academic and industrial engagement in circular packaging transitions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
