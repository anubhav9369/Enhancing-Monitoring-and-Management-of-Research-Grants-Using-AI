 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by producing more qualified technicians to meet workforce demands in cybersecurity. Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge in business, industry, and government. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect both existing and emerging technologies. In this project, the investigators aim to address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals by equipping high school and community college career counselors, academic advisers, and educators with the knowledge and resources needed to confidently guide students into cybersecurity careers. The investigators will develop materials and associated training that will reflect industry needs and present cybersecurity as a multidisciplinary field. While designed for formal advisers and counselors, the resources will also be distributed to informal advisers such as teachers, parents, and organizations that play a vital role in influencing students' career decisions. By providing those key influencers with relevant information, the project will expand awareness of cybersecurity career opportunities, making them more accessible to students. Looking beyond cybersecurity, this effort should serve as a model for expanding awareness and access to other high-demand technical fields and should advance the understanding of effective career guidance strategies.\r\n\r\nCybersecurity encompasses dozens of distinct work roles (as defined in the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity, https://www.nist.gov/nice/framework), ranging from technical roles such as penetration testing to multidisciplinary roles such as policy analysis and governance, risk, and compliance. A major barrier in addressing the cybersecurity workforce gap is a lack of understanding of the wide range of work roles that the field offers and the skills that the various jobs entail. While many colleges and universities have developed robust cybersecurity curricula, there are limited resources and training available for career counselors, academic advisers, and educators to help them confidently guide students into cybersecurity career pathways. In this project, the investigators will pursue four objectives: (1) Develop a Cybersecurity Career Awareness Toolkit for counselors, advisers, and educators; a workbook for students; and informational materials for parents and organizations. (2) Design and deliver professional development workshops to inform high school and community college counselors, advisers, and educators about cybersecurity career pathways, academic programs of study, and use of the Toolkit. (3) Establish a Community of Practice among participants to facilitate ongoing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and support in guiding students through cybersecurity career pathways and academic programs. (4) Enhance cybersecurity career awareness among students through comprehensive outreach, resources, and partnerships with a variety of institutions. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
