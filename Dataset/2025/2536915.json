 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program has been a national leader in supporting undergraduate and graduate students in Earth system science (ESS) research for nearly three decades. As the research landscape evolves in response to shifting practices and priorities, SOARS is addressing the growing demand for workforce preparedness in the private sector. Despite an increasing number of job opportunities in private industry each year, many graduating students remain underprepared for roles in this field. To bridge this critical gap, SOARS is adapting its proven multi-mentor, multi-year model by adding an option for students to be placed at private-sector companies to conduct their research projects. Students will gain exposure to careers in ESS-related industries through tailored externships and training. This refined model will emphasize leadership development and foster a strong sense of community within ESS fields, better aligning student preparation with today\u2019s employment landscape.\r\nSOARS is introducing a pioneering academic\u2013industry hybrid training model. Students will not only benefit from the immersive, comprehensive mentorship that defines the SOARS experience, but also gain firsthand insight into how private research organizations operate. Through mentorship from up to five professionals and scaffolded professional development, students will build critical skills for successful careers in both academia and industry. Through this innovative model, SOARS students will develop the essential skills needed to become effective contributors to, and leaders in, all sectors of the ESS workforce, in service of society. Building strong, connected cohorts, including robust alumni engagement, will enhance support for early-career scientists and extend the program\u2019s influence. The SOARS program aims to have 1) participants who are empowered to step into leadership roles, 2) participants who make informed career decisions, 3) supported well connected professionals who thrive in their ESS career and 4) participants trained in mentoring best practices to enhance the ESS workforce.  Ongoing evaluation and a focused alumni tracking effort will ensure continuous improvement and greater reach across the ESS and broader STEM communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
