 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of preparing the workforce to use data and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems. Data skills are important in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers, but all children will need to learn how to create, interpret, and apply data to be informed citizens. Unfortunately, many teachers lack experience with these topics or tools. They also lack opportunities to learn how these skills are applied in real STEM jobs. This means they may not be able to teach their students these skills or tell them about the jobs in these fields. This project is designed to teach prospective and practicing STEM teachers to use data and advanced technology in real science research. Teachers will learn to use the software Orange, which does not require a background in coding or analysis. Because it is easy to use, teachers can learn basic data skills quickly. After learning data and AI skills, teachers will use them in real bioscience research. They will also create classroom lessons and participate in activities to help build their confidence as members of the science community. By building their own skills and confidence in data and technology, teachers may be able to better prepare their students for future careers.\r\n\r\nThis project at Baylor College of Medicine includes partnerships with Prairie View A&M University, Texas Southern University, Houston Christian University, St. Thomas University, the University of Houston Clear Lake UHCL) Teach program, and the Houston Independent School District. Project goals include developing data analytics competencies \u2013 understanding of authentic applications of data analytics, machine learning, and AI in STEM; ability to incorporate into teaching \u2013 and deepening identities as members of the scientific community of 20 preservice and 20 in-service STEM teachers over five years by engaging them in mentored bioscience research and professional development. The theoretical Collaborative Around Research Experiences for Teachers model supports the translation of research experiences into classroom instruction through the inclusion of community building, awareness of research and careers, etc. Research experiences can improve teachers\u2019 understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry and their ability to communicate concepts and the value of science to students. Given the dearth of experiences explicitly aligned with data analytics and AI, we anticipate that participants could impact the workforce preparation of approximately 20,000 students by five years post-program. Surveys, artifacts, and rubrics will be used to evaluate impacts on skills, self-efficacy, identity and teaching practices. Curriculum, including training on the easy-to-use, visual data analysis software Orange, will be freely disseminated via our website, BioEd Online. Outcomes will be presented in conferences and peer-reviewed manuscripts. This Research Experiences in STEM Setting project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
