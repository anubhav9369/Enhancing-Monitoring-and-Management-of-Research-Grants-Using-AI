 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to about eight (8) U.S.-based doctoral students to attend the doctoral consortium at the 27th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS 2025).  ASSETS provides a leading forum for academic and industrial participants to  disseminate research that addresses the use of computing and information technologies to support a wide range of people, including persons with disabilities, people with speech, motor, hearing, and vision impairments, cognitive disabilities, emotional and learning disabilities, and aging.  The doctoral consortium is designed to provide student researchers a friendly, open forum to present their research ideas, listen to ongoing work from peer students, and receive constructive feedback while developing a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research. Student participants will present their work during the Consortium and will receive feedback from both faculty panelists and other participants to help them position and scope their work relative to related research as well as to develop the ideas and methods they employ. \r\n\r\nThe doctoral consortium also provides professionalization and career mentoring, along with opportunities to connect with other students and faculty, to support both their own career goals and to grow the SIGACCESS community.  Through these networks, the consortium also works to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations that bring both technical and behavioral expertise to bear on the hard problems of assistive technologies and universal access.  Calls for applications for funding support will be widely disseminated to attract highly qualified, early-stage doctoral students who are most likely to benefit from the mentoring and most likely to need additional funding support to attend.  Student applications will include a summary of their research and its contribution to the accessibility of field and include statements from their advisors about the benefit the student will receive; students will be selected based on the potential of their research to impact the community and the value they will both receive from and contribute to the consortium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
