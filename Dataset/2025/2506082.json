 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Carlos Meriles of the City University of New York \u2013 City College, in collaboration with Dr. Olga Shenderova of Adamas Nanotechnologies, will develop new techniques to expand the capabilities of atomic-scale sensors known as color centers. These tiny defects in diamond can detect extremely small electric and magnetic fields, making them useful for studying materials and biological systems at the nanoscale. The research team will explore novel sensing strategies to extract more detailed information and apply these methods to a broader range of scientific and technological challenges. The project will also foster educational and workforce development by training students in cutting-edge quantum sensing methods and offering research opportunities to undergraduates through established outreach initiatives. Collaborations with industry will help translate fundamental discoveries into new commercial possibilities, strengthening the link between academic research and real-world applications.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, the project will focus on three key thrusts. First, it will explore quantum magnetometry in strong magnetic fields using single-shot readout and all-optical spin control. Second, it will develop new modes of high-resolution electrometry by correlating optical signals from multiple nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Third, it will investigate how light emitted from color centers can reveal energy transfer and electromagnetic interactions at the nanoscale. These advances build on an integrated experimental platform combining confocal and atomic force microscopy, high-resolution optical spectroscopy, and magnetic resonance. The resulting techniques could enhance the sensitivity, selectivity, and versatility of color center-based sensing, expanding its use across diverse scientific domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
