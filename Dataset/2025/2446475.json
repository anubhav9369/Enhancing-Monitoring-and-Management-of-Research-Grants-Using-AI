 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the generation of potential energy at ocean gyre-scales (>1000 km) and its subsequent release to kinetic energy by mesoscale eddies. The investigators hypothesize that eddies of size 200-500 km are significant net generators of potential energy via eddy-induced upwelling and downwelling, which penetrate deep into the ocean water column. This process is an overlooked sink for mesoscale kinetic energy, implies a downward heat flux, and supports mixing in the ocean interior. The project will utilize novel and mathematically rigorous scale-analysis techniques, state-of-the-art idealized and realistic simulations, and exciting recent advances in in-situ observations of the ocean interior using Argo floats. A graduate student will participate in the project and the team will engage with the public through a collaboration with the Rochester Museum and Science Center.\r\n\r\nThe investigator hypothesizes that eddies of 200-500km size generate potential energy via eddy-induced upwelling and downwelling. This process, which penetrates deep into the ocean, could also be responsible for mixing in the ocean interior. The project will combine a suite of multiscale models and observations. Realistic regional and global eddy-resolving models will be used to estimate potential energy across different scales. Idealized models on the mesoscale and submesoscale will be employed to determine if larger scale eddies are formed through an upward cascade of energy. Observations from ARGO floats will be used to examine the three-dimensional structure of eddy velocities. Finally, coarse-graining will be applied to analyze the models and data to determine the flow of energy between eddy scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
