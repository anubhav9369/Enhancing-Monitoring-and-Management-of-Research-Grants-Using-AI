 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds an international partnership to advance marine autonomy and to train the next generation of engineers. Undergraduate students from the United States will travel to Norway to collaborate with leading researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). They will participate in hands-on research involving robotic vessels and aerial platforms used to monitor ocean activity. The project is made possible by NTNU\u2019s world-class research infrastructure, including advanced laboratories, testing basins, and a fleet of marine and aerial systems that provide a unique environment for experimentation. Through field experiments, software development, and team-based problem-solving, students will gain valuable skills in robotics, sensing, and data analysis while building international experience. This project also strengthens ties between two key Arctic nations and provides students with mentorship, networking, and career development opportunities in the global marine technology sector.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on two core challenges in autonomous marine operations. The first area develops control and planning algorithms for robotic ships, ensuring they can navigate safely and efficiently in complex maritime environments, including areas with limited sensor coverage and restricted communication. The second area explores coordination strategies for mixed teams of autonomous platforms\u2014including surface vessels, underwater vehicles, aerial drones, and satellites\u2014to conduct joint monitoring missions. A major use case is the detection and tracking of biological and physical features in coastal waters. The project integrates formal methods, machine learning, and multi-agent control to design robust and adaptable systems. Students test their algorithms in simulation and in experimental facilities, including wave basins and fjord deployments, contributing to real-world advances in autonomous systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
