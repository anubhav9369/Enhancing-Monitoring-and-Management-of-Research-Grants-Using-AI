 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the complex behavior of strongly interacting quantum systems is critical for advancing technologies that rely on quantum materials and devices. The scientific goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for predicting how these systems evolve over time, a capability that could enhance the development of future quantum technologies. By creating accurate, versatile, and broadly accessible computational tools, this research will support experimental efforts in ultracold atom physics and benefit the wider physics community. The project also incorporates educational initiatives to promote scientific literacy through computational and mathematical training, thus supporting student success in STEM fields and equipping future scientists with essential analytical skills.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to address fundamental open questions in quantum many-body physics by developing controlled numerical methods for interacting Fermi systems away from equilibrium. In the semi-classical regime, the dynamics of ultracold Fermi gases in different experimentally relevant settings is investigated using simulations of the Boltzmann equation. In the quantum-degenerate regime, diagrammatic Monte Carlo techniques are developed in the Keldysh formalism, enabling simulations of non-equilibrium strongly correlated systems, including the resonant Fermi polaron. The integration of analytical insight and numerically exact tools will give quantitative predictions across multiple interaction and temperature regimes, supporting direct comparisons with experiment and contributing to a deeper understanding of quantum matter. Integrated educational and outreach activities focus on supporting student education in fundamental mathematics and scientific programming through outreach and recruitment, as well as through the facilitation of a preparatory course for beginning undergraduates, which will help them succeed in the physics curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
