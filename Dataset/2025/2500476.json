 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced manufacturing of electronics and mechanics has been widely identified as a key regional and national priority. The \"making things\" movement is harnessing the latest 2D and 3D digital fabrication technologies to creatively combine manufacturing and entrepreneurship. Regional employers have expressed the need for employees with creative technical design skills, entrepreneurial thinking skills, and the ability to produce precision systems. The goal of this project is to create a curriculum that teaches both design thinking and robotic manufacturing of devices and systems. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop modules that will be offered through two-semester course offerings followed by an enhanced internship course for student-employer participation. The resulting educational pathway will provide students with the ability to design, troubleshoot, and prototype a common precision instrument. Students will fabricate a precision microsystem, acquiring skills such as disassembling, assembling, troubleshooting, and repairing using instructional resources, hands-on and design thinking information, and lab exercises. Students will gain experience in robotics, augmented reality, machine learning, and microelectronics and electronics systems topics. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
