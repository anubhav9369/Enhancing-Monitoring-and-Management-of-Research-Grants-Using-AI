 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores new ways to control and stabilize quantum systems that are not in equilibrium, which is an essential step for advancing quantum technologies. One leading technique for realizing new phenomena is periodic driving with external sources, such as lasers, which can be combined with other methods such as optimal control. This research aims to overcome current limitations in cooling and controlling these systems, which are crucial for simulating complex quantum behaviors. Robust control of quantum matter is a fundamental building block of quantum computers, sensors, and devices, with potential applications in energy, superconductivity, and precision measurement.\r\n\r\nThis project tackles a major challenge in quantum simulation: how to reliably prepare and stabilize exotic quantum states that arise when systems are driven out of equilibrium. By leveraging tools like Floquet engineering\u2014where periodic driving creates new effective Hamiltonians\u2014and advanced control techniques, the research aims to overcome current limitations in cooling and manipulating quantum systems such as ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits. The project focuses on three key areas: understanding how topological order emerges during non-equilibrium transitions, developing optimal control strategies in open systems, and managing resonances in periodically driven systems. These efforts promise to deepen our theoretical understanding of quantum dynamics while also offering practical protocols for experimental platforms. The broader impact includes advancing technologies relevant to quantum computing, materials science, and precision measurement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
