 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project serves the national interest in impacting workforce development for students in the School of Engineering at Colorado State University- Pueblo. The proposal is uniquely tailored to support the growing mass timber sector\u2014a timely initiative given the increasing job opportunities in this field. With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Implementation and Evaluation project will strengthen the capacity of Colorado State University-Pueblo to address a critical gap between current academic curricula and the evolving needs of the mass timber industry. The project will develop course modules aligned with industry-relevant skills, increase student awareness of mass timber career pathways, and expose students to industry-aligned learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to bridge the gap between academia and industry by identifying workforce needs in mass timber construction and developing educational materials that equip students with relevant knowledge and skills. To achieve this, the project has three objectives: (1) identify career opportunities in the mass timber industry through job market analysis; (2) assess the alignment between academic curricula and industry requirements by collecting data from students, academic units, and industry professionals through surveys and interviews; and (3) develop, implement, and evaluate educational resources that will be pilot-tested with undergraduate students. Effectiveness will be assessed through student feedback and learning outcome data. Project results will be disseminated through journal publications and conference presentations, and all educational resources, including a career pathway map, will be made publicly available through open-access platforms to support broader adoption. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
