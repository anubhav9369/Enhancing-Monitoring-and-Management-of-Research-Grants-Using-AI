 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this project aims to increase student success by ensuring every biology student at California State University San Marcos participates in multiple research experiences while enrolled in their lower- and upper-division courses. The importance of research experience for students includes building the skills they need for careers in science and healthcare, such as working in labs, solving problems, and communicating their ideas clearly. To engage all biology students in research, the project aims to develop research-based courses throughout the biology curriculum. Research projects investigate how urban development impacts wildlife and natural resources in North San Diego County. These research projects will be designed in collaboration with local resource management groups. By training students in research during their coursework, this project aims to strengthen their scientific skills, increase their academic success, and prepare them for the workforce. Students will also contribute valuable knowledge by investigating the impacts of regional urban expansion and demonstrate how research can help solve significant and real-world problems.\r\n\r\nTo meet project goals, this project will begin by forming a collaborative group of instructors and community organizations to design and improve the research-based courses. This collaboration aims to provide students with the opportunity to conduct research that informs conservation and resource management efforts, demonstrating the tangible impact of research on societal well-being. This project will also investigate how participation in research-based courses affects the support students receive from their families for their academic and career goals. The project team expects that involving families in students\u2019 research experiences will increase support academic and career aspirations and lead to better outcomes. Surveys, interviews, and institutional data will be used to evaluate how enrolling in research-based courses affects students\u2019 academic performance, interest in science careers, and motivation to continue doing research. Findings will be disseminated at regional and national conferences with an emphasis on sharing instructor resources and course materials that can be implemented effectively. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
