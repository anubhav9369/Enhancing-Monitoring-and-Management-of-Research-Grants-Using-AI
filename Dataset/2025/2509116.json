 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coding is a key part of computer science, and promoting opportunities that engage learners in coding is vital to the U.S. workforce development. This project builds upon prior research that created a free coding app, OctoStudio, which is widely available for use in elementary and secondary schools. The goals of the project are twofold: First, the team will develop and design features that broaden the technology so that it is more accessible for more users. Second, the team will explore the usability of these new features across potential users. The new features will have potential to allow blind and low vision users to meaningfully engage in coding, which ultimately benefits society by broadening the STEM workforce and bringing coding to a greater population of students.\r\n\r\nTechnological advancements in computer science rely on coding. Block-based computer programming languages are central to engaging students in learning computer science. OctoStudio is an app that engages students in block-based programming, which was developed as part of previous National Science Foundation funding. A goal of the present study is to work with elementary and middle grades students to develop new features of OctoStudio that enhance students' engagement and provide greater access. The project team will first design and develop the technological features, and then will conduct a usability study to explore the degree to which these features address users' needs, which in turn creates a feedback loop for further improvements. These features include mechanisms to navigate and edit code, develop new inputs and outputs, and resources that support students learning to use OctoStudio. This mixed-methods four-year study draws from a participatory research design. Quantitative data about students' usability perceptions and their attitudes towards coding will be collected from surveys. Additionally, coding outcomes will generate quantitative data. Qualitative data includes users' experiences as well as their comments regarding the new technological features. The quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics; the qualitative data will be analyzed using a multi-step thematic coding process. Results from this work have potential to increase learning of and access to coding and, ultimately, broaden the STEM workforce that is prepared to tackle computer-related tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
