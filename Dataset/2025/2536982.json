 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of an online biometrics data collection system. Using a webcam, the system collects biomarkers of cognitive effort and attention (heart rate and eye tracking) and emotions (facial electromyography (EMG)). This new solution has many potential applications, including the promotion of message effectiveness for content creators/advertisers. It also has the potential to enhance online training and education activities across education levels and disciplines. The system takes advantage of the naturally occurring signals produced by the body to help content creators and designers understand, in part, what is occurring in the brains of those watching messages using webcam technology.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an online tool designed to replicate the vectors of biometrics / psychophysiological data typically collected in a fixed lab location, thereby replicating the rigor of traditional in-lab biometric / psychophysiological research without the constraints of geography, time, expense, and heterogeneity. Data collection occurs via browser-based experiments with remote participants, typically yielding message effectiveness results within 24 hours. A user-friendly dashboard visualizes insights, thereby helping content creators refine creative assets quickly. Compared to traditional methods, the approach is roughly 90% faster, significantly cheaper, and easily scaled to a variety of audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
