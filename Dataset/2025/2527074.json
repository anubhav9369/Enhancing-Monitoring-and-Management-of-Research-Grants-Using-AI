 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is in replacing outdated, hazardous blood bags with a completely non-toxic alternative. Unlike conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags that contain phthalates\u2014known carcinogens and endocrine disruptors\u2014this new technology eliminates the need for harmful plasticizers and instead uses an FDA-approved, non-chlorinated polymer that keeps blood healthier for longer. Blood transfusions are lifesaving, crucial in surgeries, trauma care, and the treatment of blood disorders, kidney diseases, and neurological conditions. However, the industry faces an urgent challenge: existing blood bags contain up to 40% DEHP plasticizer, which leaches into stored blood. While DEHP helps preserve red blood cells, studies confirm its serious health risks\u2014including links to cancer, asthma, and reproductive toxicity. Regulatory bodies worldwide recognize the danger: California Proposition 65 lists DEHP as a harmful substance, and although the European Union planned to ban DEHP-containing blood bags in 2025, the absence of viable alternatives has delayed enforcement until July 1, 2030.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project combines polymer engineering, advanced materials science, and blood biology to create a next-generation composite blood bag that meets stringent medical requirements without leaching harmful substances. The challenge is balancing blood storage efficacy with commercial-scale manufacturing\u2014all while ensuring seamless integration with existing sterilization and medical standards. Early results are promising. In Phase I testing, the Xheme prototype blood bags demonstrated (a) 25% lower hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown) compared to standard PVC bags, (b) Improved metabolic activity for healthier stored blood and (c) Shelf-life performance exceeding industry standards. Now, Phase II project is driving validation and scale-up, ensuring this breakthrough technology is ready for widespread adoption\u2014ushering in a safer future for blood storage, medical care, and patient health worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
