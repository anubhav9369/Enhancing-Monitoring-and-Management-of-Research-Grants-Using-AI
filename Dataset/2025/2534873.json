 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of preparing highly qualified middle school STEM teachers to provide engaging, research-based instruction in artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. Many rural and high-need schools struggle to recruit and retain teachers with strong technological expertise. This project responds to that need by offering practicing teachers authentic research experiences in AI and cybersecurity, paired with professional learning to help translate these experiences into classroom instruction. Teachers will participate in summer research at a university lab, develop lessons that connect students to real-world technology applications, and receive mentorship during the academic year. The project has potential to increase teacher confidence, improve instructional quality, and inspire students to consider future careers in computing fields. These outcomes are significant to the general public because they expand access to high-quality computer science education, preparing students with critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for the nation\u2019s workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project at Louisiana State University includes partnerships with East Baton Rouge Parish high-need middle schools and the university\u2019s Applied Cybersecurity Lab. Project goals include preparing thirty practicing middle school STEM teachers over three years through six-week summer research experiences focused on AI and cybersecurity. Teachers will develop and implement inquiry-based lessons using the Understanding by Design framework, emphasizing critical thinking and authentic problem-solving. Research questions examine how participation in research experiences influences teacher self-efficacy, instructional practices, and retention in high-need schools, as well as the impact on student engagement and learning outcomes. A mixed-methods evaluation will include surveys, interviews, classroom observations, and analysis of teacher-developed materials. Dissemination will occur through research poster presentations, national conference sessions, and practitioner-oriented publications, contributing to the knowledge base on how research experiences influence teacher practice and student learning in K\u201312 computer science education. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K\u201312 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K\u201312 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K\u201312 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
