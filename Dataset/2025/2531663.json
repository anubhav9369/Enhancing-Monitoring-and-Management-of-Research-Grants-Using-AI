 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project provides a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a graduate student at Dartmouth College. This work is conducted in collaboration with Michael Halbig and Mrityunjay Singh at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Through the fellowship, the PI will develop multifunctional piezocomposites to enable safe operation, reliable performance, and improved thermal management in the battery systems of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. This work contributes to the broader field of intelligent material systems by addressing key challenges in aerospace electrification and pushing the boundaries of materials-by-design approaches. The resulting models and tools will guide future material design decisions and provide onsite workforce training with industry-relevant engineering skills. This project will offer key insights into processing\u2013structure\u2013property relationships, which supports data-driven materials innovation and sustainable, nationally competitive manufacturing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis fellowship focuses on the design, fabrication, and characterization of multifunctional lightweight piezocomposites tailored to enable mechanical energy harvesting for additional power generation, while providing impactful force sensing with structure integrity and thermal management solutions. The multifunctional nature of the materials directly addresses the size and weight constraints of traditional eVTOL designs, where one material only serves one functionality. The proposed methodology combines 3D printing and experimental characterization of piezocomposites with multiscale modeling to predict performance metrics, such as mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency, thermal hotspot formation, and deformation or failure mechanisms under various operating conditions. The work will strengthen Dartmouth\u2019s research infrastructure by supporting the professional development and skill expansion of junior faculty in emerging engineering areas. It will also provide equipment and laboratory upgrades, while fostering strategic partnerships with federal research institutions to promote long-term workforce development and provide hands-on training opportunities for students in New Hampshire. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Fellows, which supports early- and mid-career investigators in eligible jurisdictions to develop collaborations at the nation\u2019s private, government or academic research institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
