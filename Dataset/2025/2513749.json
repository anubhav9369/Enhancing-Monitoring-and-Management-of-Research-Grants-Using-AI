 "awd_abstract_narration": "After a period of record heat and rainfall in West Greenland, lakes which had been clear and blue rapidly turned brown and murky, a change that typically takes thousands of years. The causes and consequences of this dramatic change are largely unknown. This project offers a rare chance to understand how entire lake ecosystems respond to such rapid and severe disturbances, particularly in the sensitive Arctic biome which includes 40% of the world\u2019s lakes. These dramatic changes directly impact ecosystem function of these lakes, which includes both the stability of the food webs as well as water security for local communities. This project also helps educate the public about changes to water quality in Arctic lakes and trains the next generation of scientists and teachers, developing curriculum for K-12 students in collaboration with current teachers and making this crucial knowledge widely accessible. This project also gives science teachers the opportunity to experience hands-on field work, sample collection, and data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project uses more than a decade of previously-collected data from ten Arctic lakes in West Greenland and continues to collect observations over the next 10 years to investigate the ecosystem response to extreme weather events. The research investigates how lake ecosystems are resilient against and recover from extreme weather events, creating a framework for understanding how Arctic lakes will change in the future. Studying these metrics across the whole lake ecosystem will gain a much deeper understanding of how these critical Arctic lakes respond to rapid environmental changes. The project objectives focus on (1) quantifying the ongoing effects of extreme weather events in multiple aspects of lake ecosystems, (2) assessing  how a \u201cstability framework\u201d captures the variability in the response of ecosystem functions following these weather events, and (3) investigating how lake ecosystem processes affect the trajectory of ecosystem recovery from weather disturbances. This research will include ten years of additional data collection, experiments to test how specific lake processes respond to temperature, light, and nutrient conditions, and analysis of lake sediments to assess long-term changes in carbon nutrient cycling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
