 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nElectrochemical cells are key components of modern technologies. However, their performance is often limited by how effectively protons move through ultra-thin polymeric layers inside these devices. This project will explore new strategies to enhance proton flow by controlling how polymers sit and interact with underlying surfaces. By selectively positioning the polymers on electrodes, the research aims to influence the magnitude and direction of ionic movement near polymer-electrode interfaces, which can in turn improve the efficiency of devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, and batteries. In parallel, the project will support education and workforce development by engaging students from middle school through graduate levels in hands-on STEM activities, training K-12 teachers through virtual workshops, making classroom learning more curiosity-driven and engaging, and strengthening energy education across Nebraska. These efforts will help cultivate a skilled, future-ready energy-STEM workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the confinement- and interface-driven limitations of proton conduction in sub-micron ionomer films used in electrochemical cells. The approach will leverage interfacial chemical modifications and new ion-conducting polymer synthesis approaches to enable fundamental understanding, precise control, and enhancement of interfacial ion-conduction processes. Notably, depth-resolved proton conduction mapping, elemental profiling, structural organization, and electrochemical analysis will be integrated to examine how interfacial chemistry, ionomer composition, and chain architecture can influence chain pinning and ion conduction pathways at ionomer-electrode interfaces. The newly designed ionomers, tailored to address interfacial and confinement-related challenges, will introduce novel long-range ion-conduction pathways, and enhance proton conduction under thin film confinement. The outcomes will establish a mechanistic framework for improving ion conduction at buried interfaces and guide the design of next-generation ion-conducting materials for electrodes of energy devices. Educational activities will include strategic efforts to improve energy literacy across Nebraska, including data- and need-driven design of virtual workshops and activities for K-12 teachers and students, as well as enriching, interactive classroom learning experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
