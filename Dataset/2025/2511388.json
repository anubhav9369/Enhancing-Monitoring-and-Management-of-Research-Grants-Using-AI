 "awd_abstract_narration": "Star clusters are dense collections of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of stars. These star clusters are found around most galaxies in the Universe. This research team will study how these star clusters evolve and interact with their host galaxy. The investigators will analyze advanced computer simulations that trace the origin and evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way and their star clusters. They will create planetarium shows and other outreach programs accessible to everyone in the states of California and Texas. This program will provide research opportunities and training in coding and numerical simulations for undergraduate and graduate students in astrophysics. \r\n\r\nThe research team will use high-resolution cosmological simulations to track the orbital dynamics of long-lasting open star clusters across time and space. They will examine how an evolving potential and galactic environment impact the orbital trajectory of star clusters. They will also assess the reliability of traditional orbit modeling techniques, specifically orbit integration using a fixed potential, to accurately trace the location and history of stellar systems older than 1 Gyr. This research will generate a comprehensive multi-scale perspective into the relationship between star cluster dynamics and the evolving galactic potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
