 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable cost-effective, long-duration energy storage, which is critical to ensuring a reliable electric grid. As demand for electricity is expected to soar in the coming years, grid operators require storage systems that can operate for 10 to 24+ hours to balance the supply and demand for power and ensure resiliency. The Department of Energy forecasts that the United States' grid may need 460 gigawatts (GWs) of long-duration energy storage capacity by 2050, representing $330 billion in cumulative capital. This investment would result in $20 billion in annualized savings in operating costs and avoided capital expenditures. The innovation supported by this project has the potential to serve a significant portion of this market, particularly among electric utilities and industrial users such as data centers. The technology is based on non-toxic, non-flammable, and non-corrosive materials, which allow for safer deployment near critical infrastructure and in fire-prone regions\u2014enhancing energy access and resilience while avoiding the safety and environmental risks associated with current storage systems. In addition to economic and environmental benefits, the project may contribute to broader societal impacts by supporting domestic manufacturing and supply chains and increasing public confidence in energy infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of a full-scale purification apparatus for a proprietary low-cost, high efficiency, non-flammable, scalable flow battery system. In metal chelate flow batteries (MCFBs), trace metal impurities within the liquid electrolytes can catalyze side reactions that compromise battery efficiency and long-term performance. This project proposes a novel, reusable, and low-cost purification process that removes these impurities, enabling the use of lower-grade input materials without sacrificing stability. The Phase II objectives include: (1) validating the purification process at 24-hour discharge durations, (2) constructing a full-scale purification system, (3) building a grid-scale MCFB unit to test the electrolyte purified by this system, and (4) demonstrating 24-hour discharge battery performance using the integrated purification enhanced system. The outcomes of this project will advance the commercial readiness of the MCFB platform by enabling cost-effective electrolyte purification and enhancing system longevity\u2014key enablers for widespread deployment of long-duration energy storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
