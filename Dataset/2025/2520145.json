 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North San Joaquin Valley Regional Innovation Translation Ecosystem (NSJV-RITE) project focuses on using the region\u2019s strengths in areas including agriculture, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy to support bigger goals across the country. Its purpose is to create new jobs, help small businesses grow, and give more people access to education and job training. By bringing together local businesses, universities, and community resources, NSJV-RITE aspires to turn good ideas into real-world solutions that make life better for local residents and show how communities can lead the way in building a stronger, more innovative economy.\r\n\r\nThe project aligns with major regional efforts, including the North Valley THRIVE economic development initiative and a Collaborative which is advancing circular bioeconomy technologies. NSJV-RITE will evaluate institutional resources across two predominantly undergraduate institutions; develop shared protocols and technical service packages; and work with industry partners to refine offerings in advanced manufacturing, circular bioeconomy, and other key sectors. The initiative will also establish structured, long-term collaborations with external partners and strengthen the region\u2019s capacity for applied research. Through continuous evaluation, improvement, and shared learning, NSJV-RITE will deliver a scalable model for regional innovation that drives economic development and enhances national competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
