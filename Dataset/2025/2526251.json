 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NExT CHAMPION program aims to expand access to hydrogen energy careers and support workforce participation from all Americans. Hydrogen is a key enabler of U.S. energy security and resilience, with official reports projecting that the hydrogen sector could support up to 100,000 jobs nationwide by 2030. This initiative builds a regional hydrogen workforce pipeline by connecting two-year college students to advanced training opportunities, industry internships, and job placement services. Through strong partnerships with community colleges, industry leaders, regional workforce organizations, and four-year institutions, participants engage in hands-on learning, receive mentoring, and complete in-situ internships. The program is designed to broaden access and participation by offering mentoring, networking opportunities, and targeted interventions that address common barriers to workforce entry. The long-term goal is to strengthen the energy workforce and ensure that opportunities in hydrogen technologies are open to all Americans.\r\n\r\nThis project supports experiential learning and technical skill development for non-traditional learners pursuing careers in hydrogen energy technologies. Built around the Recruitment\u2013Awareness\u2013Mentorship\u2013Post-internship (RAMP) model, the program is developed and delivered in close collaboration with industry partners who help shape the curriculum, co-design learning activities, and host participants for immersive internship experiences. The training includes intensive modules on PEM electrolyzers, fuel cells, hydrogen safety, and infrastructure, supported by lab activities, simulation tools, and real-world case studies informed by industry input. Internships provide hands-on experience and direct mentorship in operational settings, ensuring that participants gain skills aligned with current and emerging workforce demands. The program\u2019s cognitive apprenticeship framework emphasizes modeling, coaching, articulation, and reflection. Outcomes will be evaluated using both formative and summative methods, targeting participant retention, skill development, and employment placement. Project findings and curriculum materials will be disseminated to support broader adoption in other energy sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
