 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the 2026 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Multifunctional Materials and Structures, focused on the theme Enabling Multifunctionality through AI-Informed Material Discovery and System Design, along with the accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) tailored for graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and junior researchers. The events are co-located, with the GRS scheduled for 24-25 January 2026, followed by the GRC from 25-30 January 2026. The conference will bring together researchers and practitioners from across academia, industry, and government to exchange insights, share recent advances, and strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration in emerging areas of multifunctional materials research. Support provided through this award will enable early-career researchers to attend and participate in both events, enhancing technical dialogue and scientific exchange within the field. Outcomes are expected to include new approaches to integrating intelligent materials systems with computational design and machine learning tools, as well as collaborative efforts that drive innovation across disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe conference and seminar will explore scientific challenges central to multifunctional materials and structures that exhibit adaptable, active, and reconfigurable behavior. Technical focus areas include: (a) informatics-driven discovery of materials and structures, (b) data-guided modeling and integrated system design, (c) development of intelligent and programmable materials, (d) research into synthetic and bio-integrated material systems, and (e) advancing multifunctional technologies to higher technical readiness levels. The meetings will draw a wide range of researchers with expertise in mechanics, materials science, chemistry, physics, computational engineering, and system design. Discussions will target key issues in the field and foster actionable ideas to propel progress in engineering multifunctionality for real-world applications in energy, safety, sustainability, and advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
