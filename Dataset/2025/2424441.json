 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) seeks to advance basic research in mathematics and to create an environment that fosters mathematical talent. This award supports between 8 and 12 postdoctoral fellows, and between 1 and 2 mid-career mathematicians annually (with a larger cohort for the first year of the award), and a summer program for small group collaborations. These researchers form part of the group of approximately 70 mathematicians who visit the School to pursue their research, unhampered by administrative duties. Approximately one-third of these mathematicians are part of a special program focused on a rotating topic of current interest, and the remaining are unrestricted in field. \r\n\r\nThe School actively curates an environment where scholars interact in a way that is not narrowly constrained by field boundaries. A long-running mentoring program ensures that postdoctoral Members realize their full scientific potential; each such Member is typically assigned both a mid-career and a more senior mentor. The School also hosts numerous weekly seminars across all fields of mathematics, some jointly with Princeton University, as well as regular broadly accessible colloquia, and week-long specialized workshops each term associated with the special program. Recent topics for this special program have been Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics (2024-2025), p-adic Arithmetic Geometry (2023-2024), and Dynamics, Additive Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry (2022-2023).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
