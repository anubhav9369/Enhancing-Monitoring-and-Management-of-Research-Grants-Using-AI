 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research in theoretical particle physics and cosmology at the University of California, Irvine. The Principal Investigators are Professors Jonathan L. Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, and Tim M.P. Tait, who will carry out the research in collaboration with colleagues and students at UC Irvine and elsewhere. This project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science in that it will deepen our understanding of the physical Universe at both the smallest and largest length scales, and encompasses a broad research program, including theoretical studies and model building for physics beyond the standard model, collider physics, neutrino and flavor physics, dark matter, and cosmology. The broader impacts of the group\u2019s activities are directed toward increasing public interest in and improving public understanding of the exciting research results in physics and astronomy, in addition to enhancing participation in these and other related STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe fields of particle physics and cosmology have entered a new data-driven era. A wide variety of particle physics experiments are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the fundamental building blocks of Nature with unprecedented detail. At the same time, outstanding questions stemming from a wealth of data in astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work on physics beyond the standard model, and the interaction of cosmology and particle physics has been very fruitful. The research plan exploits innovative ideas in particle physics, cosmology, and at their interface to address outstanding problems in a wide variety of fields, including searches for new physics at accelerators, neutrino and flavor physics, dark matter particle candidates and their observable signatures, and particle cosmology. The group\u2019s activities include developing and teaching a COSMOS summer course in particle physics and cosmology for high school students, a wide array of public talks and outreach activities through print and web-based media, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and around the world, and significant contributions in the area of professional service.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
