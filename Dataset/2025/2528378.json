 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Fast-Track pilot project is the transformation of chemical manufacturing through on-site, low-emission production of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide. These substances are two essential industrial chemicals, but their traditional production and distribution methods pose significant safety, environmental, and economic challenges. Transporting and storing these reactive chemicals introduces risks of spills and exposure, while centralized production processes consume large amounts of energy and generate carbon emissions. This project introduces a clean, decentralized electrochemical approach that eliminates the need for transporting hazardous chemicals, reduces energy requirements for manufacturing, and reduces emissions by up to 90%. In addition, the decentralized model supports national goals for domestic manufacturing and resilience of chemical supply chains. A domestic supply of chemicals is critical for minimizing dependency on foreign nations for national security purposes. Finally, this project develops a platform technology that could be extended beyond hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide. This solution is a safer, more cost-effective, and environmentally responsible alternative to the industrial status quo, which could address a large chemicals market and could create high-quality jobs for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe core technical innovation of this project is a novel electrochemical porous solid electrolyzer reactor that enables the coproduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from air, water, and salt. The technology comprises a unique electrolyzer architecture that enables high-concentration chemical products to be directly produced from the electrolyzer, without any post-processing steps. This technology also enables onsite co-production of these chemicals, which are used in industry for bleaching and odor control, at the point of use. In doing so it replaces two energy-intensive legacy processes: the anthraquinone process for H2O2 and the chlor-alkali process for NaOH. Phase I research will validate the ability to produce H2O2 and NaOH at tunable ratios, to demonstrate stable operation over 100 hours, and to determine shelf stability of the chemical mixture. Successful development will lay the groundwork for Phase II, which aims to optimize energy efficiency, demonstrate 1000-hour durability, and scale the reactor in preparation for commercial deployment. This platform offers a pathway to decentralize chemical manufacturing while offering cost, operation, and environmental benefits across multiple industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
