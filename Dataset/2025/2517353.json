 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advancing the semiconductor industry is a national priority, but a major skilled workforce gap is projected in the coming decade. Closing this gap requires early, proactive engagement in STEM education. This project directly addresses this need by cultivating STEM interest and skills in younger learners to prepare them for careers in this critical industry. This project will advance scientific progress and workforce development by introducing middle school students to foundational semiconductor concepts and manufacturing processes. Through hands-on experiences in community-based makerspaces, the project will directly empower approximately 110 students, 20 educators, and 16 family members across two states to develop an interest in science, engineering, and technology. Using tangible toolkits and immersive mixed reality (MR) environments, students will learn about transistors, logic gates, and integrated circuits in ways that make abstract concepts more tangible and accessible. Partnerships with organizations such as the Rockville Science Center, WestGate Academy, and the KID Museum will further support outreach and implementation efforts, helping to expand STEM education opportunities for all Americans. Co-design with families, educators, and industry partners will ensure the curriculum is relevant and responsive to the needs of the community. Research findings and curriculum resources will be made publicly available to promote wide adoption and lasting impact.\r\n\r\nThe project will follow a three-phase research and development model. In Phase I, the team will conduct co-design workshops with students, families, educators, and experts to identify learning needs and develop early prototypes. Phase II will focus on developing and piloting tangible kits and AR/VR applications through iterative workshops. In Phase III, the refined workshops will be implemented in makerspaces, and the research team will evaluate outcomes related to students\u2019 understanding of semiconductors, development of STEM identity, and interest in related careers. Guided by a design-based implementation research framework, the study will investigate how hands-on, community-based learning supports students' conceptual understanding, fosters a sense of belonging, and strengthens STEM identity, particularly through family involvement. Data collection will include pre-/post-knowledge assessments, attitudinal surveys, learning artifacts, and interviews. Mixed methods analysis, including ANOVAs and thematic analysis, will be used to evaluate the impact. This research will contribute new knowledge on how embodied, informal learning can support broader participation in advanced STEM fields and help close the gap in the semiconductor workforce pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.  This project is also co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
