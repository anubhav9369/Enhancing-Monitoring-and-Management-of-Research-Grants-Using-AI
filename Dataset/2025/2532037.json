 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a non-invasive neuromodulation oral appliance designed to relieve the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis affects 40 million U.S. adults and causes persistent nasal congestion, facial pain, mucus overproduction, headaches, and poor sleep. Existing pharmaceutical treatments rely on nasal sprays and other anti-inflammatory drugs but fail to provide relief in around 50% of patients. When medications fail, some patients may qualify for invasive and costly surgery. However, symptom recurrence after surgery is common, leaving millions of patients without an effective solution to get symptom relief. This project addresses this gap in care by exploring an alternative method that targets the nasal nerve pathways shown to contribute to excessive mucus production and inflammation. The goal is to offer a drug-free, effective, and accessible approach to improve daily functioning, sleep, and quality of life. By reducing dependence on costly medications and surgical procedures, this technology has the potential to save up to $1 billion annually on healthcare costs, improve productivity, and reduce the burden of chronic sinus disease on patients, families, and the healthcare system. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an oral device that delivers gentle electrical stimulation to nerve pathways in the nasal cavity. The technology introduces an innovative neuromodulation approach for treating the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, addressing a critical gap in current therapies that overlook the role of neural overstimulation in sinonasal inflammatory disease. Unlike existing therapies that rely on immune suppression or invasive procedures, this approach is the first to address the neurological component of chronic sinus disease using a non-invasive, drug-free method. The device is a custom-fitted mouthguard that delivers gentle electrical pulses to the nasal cavity. This neuromodulation technology was validated in a successful animal model, showing significant decongestion and improved nasal airflow. Following successful preclinical validation, the device is undergoing human testing. This early success points to the device's potential to improve chronic rhinosinusitis management, giving patients greater autonomy over symptom control and relief.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
