 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Alexej Jerschow and his group at New York University will advance the development of Zero- and Ultralow-Field (ZULF) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a cutting-edge chemical analysis technique with applications in real-time reaction and device monitoring. Unlike traditional NMR spectroscopy, which uses large, expensive magnets, ZULF NMR spectroscopy operates in very low magnetic fields, making it portable and cost-effective, while providing detailed chemical insights. This research will improve the sensitivity and precision of this new measurement modality, enabling its use in applications such as monitoring battery performance, detecting environmental changes, and analyzing chemical reactions in real time. This project will foster international collaborations with researchers in Germany and India, training students in advanced scientific fields, including in spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, and computation, and engaging students through partnerships with Pratt Institute to apply spectroscopy in art conservation. These efforts will enhance global scientific networks, support workforce development in STEM, and make chemical analysis more accessible and portable.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on developing novel sensitivity enhancement techniques, including indirect detection and optimized magnetic field sweeps, to overcome current limitations in ZULF NMR\u2019s resolution and bandwidth. Researchers will investigate relaxation mechanisms at ultralow fields using advanced computational and experimental methods to improve the method\u2019s sensitivity and versatility. These advancements will be validated through applications in battery electrolyte diagnostics, thereby demonstrating ZULF NMR\u2019s potential for in situ chemical analysis. The project\u2019s interdisciplinary approach, combining NMR spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, and sensor technology, will pave the way for portable, high-resolution chemical analysis tools with transformative potential across chemistry and materials science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
