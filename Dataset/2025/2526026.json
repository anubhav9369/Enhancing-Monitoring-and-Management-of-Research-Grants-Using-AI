 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ExLENT Explorations Track project aims to serve the national interest by expanding workforce opportunities across critical sectors such as semiconductors and microelectronics, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy systems. Built on a cross-sector partnership among two state universities, industry leaders, and nonprofit organizations, this initiative responds to pressing workforce challenges in a rural region critical to the nation's innovation economy. Although the region is home to companies at the forefront of emerging technologies, it faces workforce shortages and rising demand for college-educated employees. In response, this project engages recent high school graduates who are not pursuing college in a year-long experience that includes a residential summer practicum, paid internships, and ongoing mentorship. Importantly it also engages high school students through innovative programming that raises awareness of career opportunities in Vermont\u2019s growing innovation economy. Together these efforts help create clearer pathways into high-growth technical careers and strengthen the region's future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project advances three interconnected goals: 1) to establish a robust statewide collaboration that blends academic rigor, hands on skills training, and mentorship in high demand technology fields; 2) to ensure participants gain both the confidence and practical knowledge needed to pursue further education in meaningful career advancement; and 3) to create a shared vision for expanding educational and career options for young Vermonters who face challenges in transitioning to college or full-time employment. To achieve these goals, the initiative offers participants a curated gap year experience that includes a residential summer practicum, year-long paid internships with Vermont based companies operating in semiconductor and microelectronics advanced manufacturing sectors, and mentorship from both their host employers and faculty or staff affiliated with the state's two public universities. The project also develops new programming that directly engages at least 200 current high school students by building awareness of Vermont's emerging technology sector. Evaluation focuses on tracking participant engagement, measuring progress into college and careers, assessing growth in college and career readiness, and examining the barriers students face prior to entry, including the extent to which the program helps mitigate these.  Findings from the work will be disseminated through multiple channels aimed at reaching diverse audiences including stakeholders such as policymakers, educational leaders and industry partners through reports, publications and presentations. Overall, this effort supports a coordinated, research-informed model for expanding opportunity in emerging technology fields and strengthening the regional talent ecosystem. The NSF ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and their access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
