 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to unify the combustion research community's fragmented datasets by creating open-source, standardized databases for gas-phase chemical kinetics experiments and models. The project will develop a machine-readable, web-based, and API-accessible repository that initially compiles public data and later incorporates researcher-contributed datasets, all adhering to FAIR principles to promote accessibility and reuse. \r\n\r\nThe project develops robust cyberinfrastructure to enable, facilitate, and encourage Public Access to and the widespread reuse of experimental and modeling data, stewarding Open Science in the field of gas-phase chemical kinetics, primarily combustion. This capability building project will: 1) devise open data formats for gas-phase chemical kinetics experiments and grow an open database of such measurements; 2) create a database for kinetic models and parameters with standardized formats; 3) build an innovative data repository model based on distributed version control to eliminate barriers to use, reuse, and contribution; 4) collect publicly available experimental and modeling data to bootstrap the databases; and 5) propose workflows and \u201capps\u201d that use the database infrastructure, which will be useful in their own right, and serve as examples for others to follow in creating their own applications and workflows.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering is jointly supported by the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
