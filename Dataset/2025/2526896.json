 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF ECR Building Capacity of STEM Education Research (BCSER) program contributes to the NSF mission 42 U.S. Code Chapter 16 by building the US workforce undertaking STEM education research. The BCSER Individual Investigator Development in STEM Education Research (IID) track supports individual investigators who are experienced STEM education researchers to develop expertise in new areas that will contribute to advancing STEM education knowledge. STEM education research generates the knowledge, theories, and understandings on which viable strategies for improving U.S. STEM education and workforce outcomes are based. This project will contribute to a discipline-based theory of graduate school application using a student-centered approach with a focus on physics and astronomy. \r\n\r\nThis BCSER IID project will allow the PI to supplement their current methodological expertise with new research skills to design and implement cutting edge STEM education research using modern methods and tools. Specifically, the project will assist the PI to develop new expertise in qualitative research methods through professional development courses and mentoring with two experts in the field. New knowledge will be generated and disseminated to the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
