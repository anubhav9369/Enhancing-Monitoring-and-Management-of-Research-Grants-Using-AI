 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of a portable sensor that can detect specific chemical markers, called volatile organic biomarkers (VOBs) that are associated with colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, yet many people avoid screening due to discomfort, inconvenience, or limited access to traditional tests like colonoscopies. This project aims to improve early detection of CRC using a simple, low-cost, non-invasive test that analyzes breath or urine instead of requiring stool samples or invasive procedures. This new approach could significantly improve access to screening, by offering a test that is fast, painless, and easy to use.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a colorectal cancer screening system that employs screen-printed electrodes combined with metal salts in a custom-designed electrolyte, optimized via molecular modeling to selectively bind CRC-associated volatile organic biomarkers (VOBs). This platform builds on electrochemical sensing architectures developed in prior tuberculosis VOB detection studies, re-engineered here for CRC-specific biomarkers. While the application and biomarkers differ, the underlying sensor design and signal processing pipeline provide a validated technical foundation for CRC-specific adaptation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
