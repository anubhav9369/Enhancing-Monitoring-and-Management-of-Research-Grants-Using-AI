 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a modular servohydraulic actuator system at the University of Kentucky, enabling controlled static and dynamic testing of structural components for transformative, cross-disciplinary research. The system\u2019s versatility opens new pathways for experimental investigations into seismic simulation, impact loading, and full-scale testing of engineered wood products crafted from sustainably harvested hardwood species native to the region. Spanning three colleges and six departments, this initiative will catalyze research in infrastructure resilience, advanced structural design, and sustainable materials - bridging Engineering, Architecture, and Agriculture. The platform seeks to enhance additive manufacturing research at the component level and provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, strengthening the pipeline for innovation in construction technologies. The system will be a shared resource, accessible to academic and industry collaborators across the region and nationally.\r\n\r\nThe actuator system comprises three independently operated servohydraulic actuators with flexible orientation options, enabling a range of test configurations. Its integrated data acquisition system supports 64 channels, allowing researchers to simultaneously monitor multiple sensors across varied experimental setups. Research facilitated by this system will include studies of strengthening techniques for concrete and steel beams, such as Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) rod panels and Near Surface Mounted (NSM) Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) strips and rods as well as performance evaluations of hybrid materials like Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) combined with conventional concrete. The system will also support testing of 3D-printed concrete elements, Large-Scale Additively Manufactured (LSAM) components, Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) fill materials, and Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels developed from sustainably sourced hardwoods. This instrument will significantly expand experimental capabilities and foster innovation in resilient infrastructure and sustainable material development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
