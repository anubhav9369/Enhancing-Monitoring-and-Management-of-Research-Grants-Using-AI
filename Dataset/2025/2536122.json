 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Innovative Grant Network for Institutional Transformations and Excellence (IGNITE) planning project will explore an approach to expanding the capacity of community colleges to contribute to the national research enterprise. California\u2019s 116 community colleges educate over 2.1 million students annually, serving as a major training pipeline for the U.S. technical workforce. With this award, the awardee will plan a project that aims to build a centralized, flexible research support model, called the IGNITE Hub, to help colleges pursue research funding, reduce administrative burden, and improve student opportunities to build skills needed for jobs in science, technology, and other skilled trades. This effort promotes national economic competitiveness, workforce development, and STEM innovation by making it easier for community colleges to engage in research.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo lay the groundwork for the IGNITE Hub, this planning grant will conduct a statewide study of research readiness across the CCCs and engage stakeholders to identify common needs and service gaps. The project will use a mixed-methods approach to analyze research capacity. Design labs with up to six partnering colleges, with varying support needs and capacities, will test potential solutions and inform the development of a scalable centralized support model for shared research support. The project will generate new insights into how centralized services can operate effectively and efficiently across independently governed colleges while maintaining flexibility. Findings will be relevant to colleges seeking shared infrastructure and will inform how to increase community college participation in the national research enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
