 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Institutional Partnership Pilot (NRT-IPP) award led by Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT) and Boston University (BU), will create a Master of Science (MS) degree program in bioengineering designed to meet demand for professionals in the biotechnology and biomanufacturing industries. Bioengineering is a rapidly expanding field in Massachusetts, which serves as a national hub for the biotechnology industry. This project addresses a shortage of bioengineers by providing students with industry-relevant skills, hands-on research opportunities, and career development experiences. The program integrates coursework, immersive research, and paid industry internships, ensuring graduates are well-prepared to transition into STEM careers and contribute to the bioengineering sector. Trainees will gain expertise in bioengineering product development, medical device design, biomanufacturing, and computational modeling, among other key areas. The project anticipates training 100 students over five years, including 25 fully funded trainees. This degree program at WIT will leverage BU\u2019s expertise in bioengineering graduate education and workforce development, incorporating sustainable and effective training practices from its NRT program in neurophotonics.\r\n\r\nThe project combines educational practices with industry engagement to ensure students acquire needed skills and competencies. The program\u2019s curriculum includes courses tailored to industry needs, professional development workshops, and technical training in cutting-edge tools. By partnering with biotechnology companies, WIT students will gain paid work experience in real-world settings through a structured cooperative program. Additionally, trainees will conduct interdisciplinary research in areas such as medical imaging, biosensing, tissue engineering, and digital therapeutics. This research-driven approach, coupled with industry mentorship, will bridge the gap between academia and the workforce, fostering innovation and technological advancements. The project will provide a replicable model for STEM graduate education. The anticipated outcomes include a highly trained workforce and broad societal benefits from biomedical technology developments that address pressing challenges.\r\n\r\nThe NRT Institutional Partnership Pilot (NRT-IPP) is a collaborative effort between the Directorates for STEM Education (EDU) and Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) to support research and education projects with high industry relevance in emerging fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
