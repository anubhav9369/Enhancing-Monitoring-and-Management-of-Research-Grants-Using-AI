 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on investigating the commercial potential of two novel technologies for powder fabrication processing and additive manufacturing that enable the scalable production of metal-graphene composites with tailored thermal and mechanical properties. The innovations target unmet needs across industries that demand lightweight, high-performance metallic structures capable of operating in thermally and mechanically demanding environments. Current manufacturing techniques are limited in their ability to achieve high thermal conductivity and strength simultaneously while maintaining scalability and cost-efficiency. Both techniques provide pathways to overcome those limitations by offering site-specific control of thermal and mechanical properties at the micrometer level. The broader impact of the technologies lies in their potential to improve energy efficiency, reduce material waste, and enhance manufacturing agility in sectors such as aerospace, energy, and advanced transportation, thus supporting national goals in high-tech manufacturing and advanced materials innovation.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of methods that enable the in-situ formation of quasi-continuous graphene structures covering metal powders. The technologies can be integrated into additive manufacturing processes to directly print metal graphene composites. The processes can also be used to prepare graphene-covered metallic powders for additive manufacturing techniques, such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), and laser direct energy deposition (LDED). Moreover, the graphene covered metallic powders can be used to fabricate wires for laser wire deposition and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). These methods enable precise control of microstructures in additively manufactured components, tuning the thermal and mechanical performance, and enabling cost-effective, and scalable production of components with enhanced functionality. By simplifying the manufacturing steps and offering microstructural control at the micrometer level, this approach could represent an advance in the additive manufacturing of next-generation metal-graphene composites for mission critical applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
