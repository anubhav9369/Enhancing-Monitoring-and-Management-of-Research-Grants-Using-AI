 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) award supports the development of a groundbreaking machine learning-assisted multi-material 3D printer with a novel hybrid deposition process, enabling transformative research in polymer composites and smart additive manufacturing. As the first system of its kind, the instrument seeks to pioneer the integration of continuous fiber reinforcement and liquid-like polymer inks, allowing unprecedented precision in manufacturing high-performance composite structures and functional devices. The platform\u2019s unique capability to combine multiple curing and anchoring functions with machine learning-driven process optimization seek to advance research in process-structure-property relationships and in-situ monitoring, filling a critical gap in existing multi-material printing technologies. This innovation is expected to catalyze nationwide efforts in smart manufacturing, improve utilization of natural bio-polymer resources, and foster new opportunities in AI-powered engineering and design.\r\n\r\nThe 3D printing system will serve as a regional and national research hub, supporting a wide range of science and engineering disciplines through collaborative access across academic institutions and industry. Housed in a shared facility, it will offer training and research opportunities to students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty, while its remote access and shared governance model will actively engage primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. By equipping researchers with advanced tools to design and prototype smart composite devices, the project intends to elevate regional competitiveness and contribute to workforce development in key areas such as machine learning, materials science, and advanced manufacturing. The hybrid additive manufacturing platform looks to also enable high-fidelity production of next-generation composites, supporting diverse applications from aerospace structures to bio-integrated devices, and reinforcing the U.S. leadership in smart, sustainable manufacturing technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
