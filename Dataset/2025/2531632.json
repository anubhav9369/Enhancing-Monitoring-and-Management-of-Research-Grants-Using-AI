 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of students from U.S.-based institutions in the IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP) 2025, taking place in person from July 19\u201323, 2025, at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Now in its seventeenth year, ICCP is the premier annual conference dedicated to computational photography, bringing together researchers from optics, image and signal processing, computer vision and graphics, and sensor and electronics communities. The ICCP 2025 program features keynote and invited talks, technical paper presentations, poster and demo sessions, and networking opportunities\u2014fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing an engaging environment for both junior and senior researchers to exchange ideas and mentorship.\r\n\r\nThis award offers travel grants to 20 U.S.-based students, selected through a competitive process by a committee of ICCP 2025 organizers. Grants will partially cover travel, lodging, and registration expenses. Selected students are expected to fully participate in the ICCP program\u2014including all talks, poster/demo sessions, and networking events\u2014and will present their own research in a poster session. They will also take part in a mentoring event with academic and industry professionals offering guidance on research and career development. Additionally, recipients will attend the inaugural ICCP Summer School on Computational Imaging, featuring lectures by leading experts on active research topics in the field. Participation in ICCP 2025 will support students\u2019 professional growth, enhance their research skills, and offer valuable networking opportunities. This initiative aims to strengthen the future STEM workforce by encouraging students to pursue careers in science and engineering, while simultaneously enriching the broader computational photography and computing research communities. Ultimately, this program contributes to increasing the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, thereby advancing the development of impactful technologies for society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
