 "awd_abstract_narration": "The activity and interconnectivity of neurons, a key type of brain cell, are crucial to the brain's ability to compute and process information. However, recent studies suggest that astrocytes, a different type of brain cell, may also play an important role. This project combines experiments and computational modeling to study how astrocytes contribute to brain function. Astrocytes affect many aspects of neuronal activity and communication, providing a potential mechanism by which they can alter signaling in the brain. The computational modeling and mathematical analysis within the project will enable a deeper biological understanding of these astrocyte-neuron interactions, generate new ideas for why they may be important for information processing in the brain, and suggest ways to integrate these principles into artificial intelligence systems. In conjunction with the modeling will be experiments to observe and manipulate astrocytes in living brains. In so doing, the project will validate new ideas about astrocytes' roles in the brain, providing an enhanced understanding of neural circuits and brain function. \r\n\r\nThe scientific premise of this project is the \"contextual guidance\" hypothesis, which postulates that astrocytes act as switchboards that transmit information about the environment and the physiological state of the organism to neurons and networks thereof. As such, astrocytes may act as a force multiplier that can expand the repertoire of dynamics that neurons can realize, thus enabling computation. The project will explore two ideas in this regard: (i) that astrocytes actively modulate neuronal dynamics in response to signals sensed from the environment, and (ii) this modulation enables neuronal networks to tailor their dynamics in response to context-specific circumstances. To substantiate these ideas, the project will investigate the role of astrocytes in neuromodulatory systems and subsequent effects on neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the project will examine network-level interaction between neurons and astrocytes, exploring features like \"tiling,\" where astrocytes overlay neuron clusters to influence signal routing. In addition to scientific insights, the research will examine how brain-inspired computing may be enhanced by new artificial neural network designs that incorporate astrocytes, with a focus on context-dependent computational paradigms. Additionally, the project includes initiatives to engage trainees in interdisciplinary neuroscience research and exchange, including new mini-courses that bridge neuroscience, engineering and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nA companion project is being funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
