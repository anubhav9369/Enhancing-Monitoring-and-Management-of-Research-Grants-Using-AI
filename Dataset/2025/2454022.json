 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program Regional Alliance project aims to recognize outstanding STEM educators in high-need schools that advance educational excellence in the Southeast Region. This project will support 16 STEM Teacher Corps Members by recognizing and rewarding their accomplishments and effort to enhance mathematics teaching and learning in secondary schools. The project will also provide professional development, mentorship and support to 100 other teachers of mathematics by supporting the Mississippi STEM Education Alliance (MESA). This Alliance will work to recognize exemplary mathematics teachers and collaborate with them to design and facilitate professional development opportunities for mathematics teachers across the state. Teacher Corps Members will also share their experiences with other teachers and support teachers in rural communities to gain the content knowledge and certifications needed to effectively teach secondary mathematics. These National STEM Teacher Corps members will gain recognition as models to which in-service and pre-service teachers can aspire.\r\n\r\nThis project at the University of Mississippi includes partnerships with the Mississippi Department of Education and local school districts in each Congressional district across the state. The goals of the project aim to support teachers who will serve as facilitators, working with Alliance partners to create professional development institutes and design a Statistics and Data Literacy course for Mississippi high school students. The National STEM Teacher Corps Members will be trained to serve as professional development facilitators who will impact other teachers and help them obtain supplemental teaching endorsements in critical content shortage areas. This program aims to endorse an estimated 100 additional teachers in Middle School Mathematics, Algebra, and Geometry within five years, ensuring that students have access to robust learning opportunities. The program will collect pre- and post-assessment data to measure the impact on teacher content knowledge. Additionally, the Mississippi STEM Education Alliance will establish an online hub that will consolidate information related to professional development and student opportunities. This online information hub will be available to all Mississippi STEM teachers and will be used to connect the STEM learning efforts of all Mississippi STEM Education Alliance partners. The NSF National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program supports outstanding STEM educators in high-need schools that advance educational excellence in our Nation\u2019s preK-12 classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
