 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores how certain types of molecules come together to form tiny structures that can be useful in medicine, energy, and the environment. These molecules are special because they have parts that like water and parts that don\u2019t, so they naturally organize themselves when mixed with liquids. This self-organization can lead to the creation of materials like soft particles or thin films, which are useful for carrying medicine, storing energy, or cleaning up pollution. The research will focus on understanding what happens when these molecules first form small liquid droplets and then transform into solid particles. By learning how this process works, scientists can better control the design of new materials for specific uses. For example, it could help create better ways to deliver medicine exactly where it's needed in the body or make materials that capture and store energy more efficiently. Additionally, the project emphasizes education and outreach, and will actively involve students and local schools in engaging activities to inspire future scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to fundamentally understand the structure, dynamics, and encapsulation behavior of multiphase amphiphilic block copolymers in solution. The research is divided into three aims. First, a comprehensive library of block copolymers will be synthesized, and their phase behaviors will be systematically mapped using advanced characterization techniques, including electron microscopy, optical microscopy, and X-ray scattering. The outcomes of this aim will establish robust relationships between polymer structures, solution conditions, and their phase behaviors. The second aim will explore the internal structure and dynamics of the polymer phases using sophisticated techniques such as in-situ Synchrotron X-ray Scattering, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, and Liquid Phase Electron Microscopy. This integrated approach will provide unprecedented insight into the transformation from liquid droplets into solid particles, significantly advancing the fundamental understanding of amphiphilic polymer assembly. The third aim focuses on studying how these polymer systems encapsulate small molecules, essential for applications like drug delivery. Using model encapsulants and confocal microscopy, the research will elucidate the relationships between polymer properties, phase behaviors, and encapsulation efficiency. Overall, this research will offer transformative insights into polymer self-assembly, enhancing our ability to design advanced, functional materials with broad applications across biotechnology, sustainability, and energy fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
