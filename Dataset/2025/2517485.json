 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to create a coalition of geospatial innovation organizations across all sectors of society (public, private, and governmental) to explore how spatial science can be more fully represented in offerings of informal STEM education in the Greater St. Louis region. The coalition seeks to identify gaps, remove silos, and enable better collaboration, knowledge- and resource-sharing. By establishing shared goals, partnership building, and decision-making processes, the coalition will identify expertise and gaps in the region and share these findings in the form of a white paper.\r\n\r\nThe informal STEM learning field will be advanced through the development of a white paper focused on geospatial science as well as a discussion of the frameworks guiding partnership development. As such, the white paper will include lessons learned throughout the process, including implementation of Collaboration Evaluation and Improvement Framework, and recommendations for implementing geospatial science specifically in informal environments. The project should benefit the Greater St. Louis community, as well as inform and advise other groups across the nation that endeavor to create similar partnerships. The long-term vision for next steps for the coalition is to design, develop, and implement a geospatial science curriculum that can be shared and adapted for communities across the nation. Cultivating youths\u2019 interests in STEM in an environment outside of the classroom sets them up for a future in STEM, whether for personal interest or for a career and provides a tremendous benefit to both local communities and to society at large.\r\n\r\nThis Partnership Development & Planning project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing everyone multiple pathways for accessing and engaging in STEM learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
