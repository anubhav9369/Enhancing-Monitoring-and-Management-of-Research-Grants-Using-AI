 "awd_abstract_narration": "The BRIDGE-TECH (Building Relationships in Innovation and Development for Growth in Emerging Technologies) project brings together a cohort of five primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) committed to strengthening regional innovation ecosystems by removing barriers to research, workforce development, and technology commercialization. These institutions each serve regions with untapped economic and technological potential but face common challenges such as limited research infrastructure, fragmented partnerships, and underdeveloped support for technology transfer. Through a coordinated, cohort-based approach, the project will empower faculty and communities by developing sustainable industry partnerships, supporting entrepreneurial programming, and expanding access to emerging technologies. Ultimately, BRIDGE-TECH seeks to build ecosystems where innovation thrives and contributes to long-term economic benefits.\r\n\r\nTechnically, BRIDGE-TECH proposes a scalable model to increase innovation capacity at PUIs through strategic capacity-building and shared institutional development. The project focuses on five interrelated goals: (1) increase industry-sponsored research, (2) enhance innovation culture and technology transfer, (3) develop design thinking and innovation accelerator, (4) drive and expand innovation in rapid manufacturing, and (5) create synergistic opportunities for academic research. Each institution will implement customized, locally grounded activities, such as creating innovation centers, forming regional councils, conducting ecosystem assessments, and launching faculty fellows programs, while leveraging cohort-wide training workshops and shared resources. The anticipated outcomes include increased research funding, expanded partnerships with industry entities, improved IP and commercialization processes, and the training of over 40 faculty members. The collaboration ultimately aims to elevate the role of PUIs in national innovation networks while supporting sustainable economic development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
