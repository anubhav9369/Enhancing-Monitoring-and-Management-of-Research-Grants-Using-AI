 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of preparing highly qualified K-12 STEM teacher leaders to address emerging workforce demands in microelectronics. The rapid expansion of the microelectronics industry in the United States reflects a critical need to strengthen national security and economic competitiveness. This expansion requires K-12 teachers to be equipped with microelectronics content knowledge and integrated STEM pedagogical practices to inspire and prepare students for future careers in this vital sector. Over six years, the project will recruit and prepare two cohorts of 12 practicing K-12 teachers (24 total) to become Microelectronics Master Teacher Fellows, supporting the integration of microelectronics-focused curricula and instruction in high-need school districts. These teacher leaders will have the opportunity to play a critical role in fostering student interest in STEM fields and preparing the next generation for careers in the growing microelectronics industry. By promoting workforce-relevant STEM teaching practices, the project has the potential to advance opportunities toward STEM career pathways for K-12 students. Additionally, the experiences and insights gained through this initiative will contribute new knowledge on strategies for equipping STEM teachers to integrate emerging workforce contexts, such as microelectronics, into K-12 classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis project at Purdue University leverages partnerships with the Regional Opportunity Initiatives workforce development organization, the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Crane Division, and the Silicon Crossroads Microelectronics Commons Hub to serve four school districts: Washington Community Schools, Lafayette School Corporation, Loogootee Community Schools, and Purdue Polytechnic High Schools, spanning both rural and urban settings near microelectronics facilities. The project will provide advanced professional development through microelectronics-focused summer institutes, graduate coursework, and annual summits, while supporting teachers in leading district-wide vertical alignment plans for microelectronics education. The 24 master teacher fellows will be provided opportunities to develop expertise in microelectronics-related content/technologies, STEM pedagogy, and leadership to embed microelectronics-focused STEM initiatives into school districts. Project goals include supporting teacher retention in high-need schools, inspiring/preparing students for microelectronics careers, and creating national exemplars of microelectronics-integrated school districts. The project\u2019s evaluation and research will assess the impact of its strategies, with findings disseminated through national conferences, microelectronics hubs, and open-access platforms for instructional materials. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts. This project is funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and is supported in part by funds from the Micron Technology, Inc.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
