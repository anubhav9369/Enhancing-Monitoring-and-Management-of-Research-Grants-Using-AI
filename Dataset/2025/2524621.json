 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Educational Instrumentation project at California State University-Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) will strengthen undergraduate learning in Biophysics. Specifically, this project will secure Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Optical Tweezers, Spectrometer for Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), Raman Spectrometer, and Electrophoresis Equipment which will allow students to develop practical skills gained from working with these advanced instruments in BPH 330: Biological Physics, BPH 340: Experimental Biophysics, BPH 460: Advanced Microscopy, and BPH 475: Quantum Biology, preparing them for future academic and professional opportunities in competitive STEM fields. An estimated 100 students will utilize the project-funded equipment each year. The integration of advanced instruments in the Biophysics shared research facility will directly benefit approximately 100 CSUDH students annually through hands-on training in key laboratory courses and research projects. The initiative will also provide high school students with exposure to advanced scientific research while offering leadership and mentoring experience to CSUDH students.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to enrich the learning and experiences of undergraduate students by providing critical equipment in biophysics. The integration of high-caliber instruments such as the Atomic Force Microscope, Electrophoresis Equipment, Raman Spectrometer, and Optical Tweezers into the curriculum will transform how biophysical concepts are taught and researched. The new equipment will enable both faculty and students to undertake more ambitious and cutting-edge research projects. Equipment such as the Atomic Force Microscope will allow researchers to observe and manipulate molecules at the atomic level, a critical tool in nanotechnology research. The project will assess the impact of the project funded equipment using pre- and post-assessment tools to measure mastery of techniques and concepts related to equipment use. Long-term outcomes will be tracked using key metrics such as student retention, graduation rates, and professional placements. Surveys will gather data from alumni on graduate school enrollment, employment, and research achievements. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
