 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for semiconductor manufacturing is expected to increase nationally and globally at unprecedented levels. It is projected that the semiconductor and nanotechnology workforce in the US will increase by 115,000 positions, and that approximately 40% of these positions are expected to be at the technician level. The goal of the Microelectronics and Nanotechnology Pathway in Applied Science and Technology (MNTPAST) project at Tompkins Cortland Community College (TC3) is to enhance and expand TC3\u2019s Applied Science and Technology program by developing a concentration in microelectronics and nanotechnology that will help meet the demands of the semiconductor industry. The project will leverage the power of incorporated technologies that provide progressive, scaffolded experiences leading to real-world relationships in academic and career settings.\r\n\r\nThe two key objectives of the project are to: (1) Modify and develop credit-bearing education in microelectronics and nanotechnology leading to new and revised curriculum, stackable micro-credentials, technical coursework towards the completion of an associate's degree, and employment opportunities; and (2) Increase the awareness and experience with microelectronics and nanotechnology for students in grades 7-12 through hands-on activities, family engagement, teacher workshops, and outreach to school district counselors, administrators, and school boards. Industry partners will guide the development of the curriculum and provide applied learning opportunities to students. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program and is supported in part by funds from Intel Corporation under the ETSTE DCL. The program focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
