 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project provides a fellowship to an Assistant Professor and training for a graduate student at Louisiana State University (LSU). This work is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mentink-Vigier at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). Through the fellowship, the PI will investigate how uropathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria, which cause urinary tract infections, form resilient biofilms that resist antibiotics. The project integrates chemistry, microbiology, and biophysics to study how biofilm components like cellulose and curli proteins interact to form protective barriers. The research will use advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to reveal the biofilm structures in their native state, which may inform new strategies for treating persistent infections. Other benefits of the award include expanding Louisiana\u2019s capacity in biomolecular NMR, training a STEM workforce in cutting-edge methods, and fostering collaboration with national research facilities.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the atomic-level and supramolecular architecture and dynamics of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in Escherichia coli biofilms, with a focus on cellulose and curli amyloid fibers. The intellectual contribution includes the development of new NMR and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) methods for probing intact biofilms and advancing understanding of how EPS interact to form protective matrices in their native state. The PI will employ multidimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy, selective isotope labeling, and DNP to suppress bacterial cellular signals, enabling selective detection of EPS components in situ. The project will enhance research infrastructure by supporting development in biomolecular NMR and strengthening LSU\u2019s capacity for cutting-edge magnetic resonance techniques. Activities will integrate with broader institutional goals by expanding methodology for biofilm research, fostering student mentorship, and promoting workforce development in structural biology. Collaboration with NHMFL will provide LSU researchers with access to state-of-the-art instrumentation and catalyze future partnerships.  This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Fellows, which supports early- and mid-career investigators in eligible jurisdictions to develop collaborations at the nation\u2019s private, government or academic research institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
