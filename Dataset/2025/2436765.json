 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data Science is a transformative field that has come to profoundly impact every aspect of society. As such, providing widespread data science education is essential for cultivating a skilled and engaged workforce while ensuring national competitiveness in this rapidly growing domain. Currently much of the focus in undergraduate education has been on creating courses and programs for majors and minors, yet this approach leaves a significant gap: students outside data science programs often lack opportunities to develop essential data skills and fail to recognize valuable and innovative connections to data science. However, data literacy is critical for college students across all disciplines, enabling them to thrive in both their personal and professional lives. Therefore, connecting data science to diverse fields and real-world challenges while fostering collaborations with domain experts and community partners will inspire, prepare, and engage students with a data-driven world.\r\n\r\nThe CROSSROADS (Creating Robust Opportunities for Student Success through Real-world, Organized, and Applied Data Science) program is designed to create flexible pathways into, through, and beyond data science education for a broad spectrum of students while promoting engagement with real-world applications. This project aims to establish an interdisciplinary education ecosystem through three key components: (a) Domain Exploration Modules that integrate data science into diverse disciplines to enhance data literacy among general students and enrich data science education for majors and minors; (b) Data Science Studio, as the core of a practicum system that provides hands-on learning through student collaborations with community partners; and (c) Data Science Collaborative Workshops, fostering partnerships among educators, students, and community organizations to drive curriculum innovation and impactful community service. Additionally, the resources and findings developed by the project will be freely available online, enabling other institutions to adopt and adapt these creative approaches and thoughtfully designed materials to strengthen their curricula. Through these efforts, the project addresses critical gaps in data science education and provides a holistic model that promotes real-world learning opportunities for all students while contributing to the development of a competitive and skilled national workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Data Science Corps program, which supports data science education and training to build a strong national data science infrastructure and workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
