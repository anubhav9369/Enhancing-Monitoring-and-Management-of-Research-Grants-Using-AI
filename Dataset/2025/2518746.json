 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project aims to serve the national interest by exploring the use of augmented reality (AR) as an educational tool in undergraduate chemistry courses. Since learning chemistry involves abstract structures and spatial reasoning, AR tools offer opportunities to help students visualize and interact with chemical phenomena in new ways. However, instructors and curriculum designers currently lack clear, research-based guidance on how to use AR effectively in teaching. This project investigates how AR applications can enhance learning by supporting student engagement with complex spatial concepts, using molecular symmetry as a test case. The research will identify which features of AR tools contribute to student understanding, how students with different learning approaches use these tools, and how faculty incorporate them into classroom instruction. Outcomes will help shape future AR tool development and inform best practices using them in the classroom. The project will also support instructor development and prepare future researchers in the field of chemistry education.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project between Indiana University and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, investigates the affordances and limitations of augmented reality tools in undergraduate chemistry instruction. Anchored in theoretical frameworks from constructivism, embodied cognition, spatial thinking, representational competence, and technological pedagogical content knowledge, the research will explore how the leARnCHEM augmented reality application can support undergraduate students' learning of molecular symmetry. The project will examine (1) which AR features support student understanding of symmetry elements and operations, (2) how student characteristics such as prior knowledge and spatial reasoning influence AR engagement, and (3) how instructors plan for and implement AR-based instruction. The project employs a convergent mixed-methods design, including think-aloud interviews, pre/post assessments, classroom observations, and instructional workshops across multiple institutions. Comparative studies will assess student engagement with AR versus non-AR digital resources. Findings will inform instructional strategies and technology design in chemistry education. Dissemination efforts include peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and professional development workshops. The NSF IUSE: EDU program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
