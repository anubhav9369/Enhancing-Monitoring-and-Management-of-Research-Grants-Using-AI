 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a specialized disconnection device designed to address the challenges faced by nurses, patients, and family caregivers in safely disconnecting luer connections from various catheters. The project aims to improve patient safety, patient outcomes, nurses\u2019 efficiency, while also reducing healthcare costs by providing a reliable solution to a widespread problem in healthcare settings. Luer connections are essential for managing catheters, but their disconnection often leads to complications, including catheter damage and increased risk of medical errors. This device securely grips luer connections and catheters of varying sizes, allowing for safe and efficient disconnection without causing damage. The adoption of this solution is expected to positively impact patient care, minimize the use of off-label instruments and workarounds, and lower overall healthcare costs by reducing the need for catheter repairs and replacements. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a symmetric, U-shaped disconnection device with two arms connected at one end and open at the other. The device's design includes ribbed areas for firmly grasping and two main grip sizes to accommodate different luer connections and varied catheter types. The technical advancements of this device include its ability to securely surround luer connections and catheters, providing the necessary leverage for safe disconnection, and ultimately contributing to better patient safety, patient outcomes, nurses\u2019 efficiency, and reduced healthcare costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
