 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project provides a fellowship to an Associate professor and training for a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maine. This work is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yuan Yue at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Through the fellowship, the PI will investigate how multivalent metal ion treatment induces hydrophobization and improves dimensional stability in cellulose  and wood based materials. This project addresses fundamental questions about cellulose\u2011water interactions, hydroxyl accessibility, and microfibril assembly in the presences of multivalent metal cations. The research employs advanced characterization techniques including small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering, infrared atomic force microscopy, and neutron computed tomography. The results will inform sustainable approaches to water\u2011resistant cellulosic materials, benefiting industries in packaging, textiles, and construction, while strengthening Maine\u2019s capacity for renewable materials innovation.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance fundamental knowledge in cellulose chemistry and functionalization, and conduct comprehensive mechanistic studies spanning molecular to macroscale levels across pulp, paper, and wood systems. The work will make significant intellectual contributions by developing a mechanistic framework that links metal cation coordination, microfibril reorganization, and emergent hydrophobicity. The PI and postdoctoral fellow will conduct experiments at ORNL, leveraging world-class scattering and spectroscopic instrumentation alongside deuteration protocols to isolate water-cellulose interactions with unprecedented precision. This fellowship will enhance research infrastructure by advancing faculty expertise in biomaterials characterization and training with cutting-edge methods. Insights gained will be translated into coursework, workshops, and guidance for other researchers seeking access to ORNL instrumentation. The project further supports mentorship of undergraduates and graduate students, encourages collaborative proposals, integrates findings into educational and workforce development programs, and increases the adoption of advanced techniques across Maine research communities. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Fellows, which supports early- and mid-career investigators in eligible jurisdictions to develop collaborations at the nation\u2019s private, government or academic research institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
