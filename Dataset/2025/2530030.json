As the premier international conference in computer vision, CVPR attracts over 10,000 participants annually, showcasing advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and image analysis. The Doctoral Consortium provides a dedicated platform for Ph.D. students to present their research, engage in deep discussions with senior scholars, and receive valuable mentorship to support their career development. By funding travel for approximately 25 students from a wide range of U.S. academic institutions, this award helps nurture the next generation of researchers and broadens participation in a leading technical community.\r\n\r\nSelected students will take part in structured consortium activities, including poster sessions, mentorship groups, and career-focused discussions. The travel awards will help cover expenses such as airfare, lodging, and local transportation, ensuring that talented students\u2014especially those with limited financial resources\u2014can attend. Recipients will be chosen by the 2025 CVPR Doctoral Consortium chairs based on research potential, alignment with the conference themes, and the impact of participation on their academic and professional growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
