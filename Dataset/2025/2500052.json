 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by addressing the growing demand for skilled technicians in robotics and automation, critical to maintaining food security and supporting the manufacturing workforce. It plans to create an educational pathway that attracts and retains diverse students, preparing graduates for well-paying jobs in rural areas with limited opportunities. By aligning education with industry needs, the project will equip businesses to adapt to an increasingly automated future. Its innovative strategies, including industry partnerships and immersive summer institutes, will engage students, highlight career opportunities and provide industry-recognized credentials, demonstrating the significance of bridging educational gaps in advanced technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the shortage of skilled robotics and automation technicians in the agricultural and industrial sectors through targeted approaches. The project goals include: (1) capturing student interest via immersive summer institutes, (2) increasing representation using evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and (3) reducing math anxiety through a pre-enrollment math jumpstart course. An introductory and advanced summer institute intends to provide hands-on experience and National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3) certifications in entry-level robotics and automation. Faculty expertise will be strengthened through NC3 Teacher Certifications and professional development. The project plans to assess summer institutes' impacts on associate degree enrollment, pathway strategies on graduation rates, and the effectiveness of math jumpstart courses in reducing anxiety and boosting enrollment in math-heavy programs. Findings intend to offer data-driven insights to improve technician education and workforce development. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
