 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2025 NSF Manufacturing Blue Sky Competition will be held at the NAMRC/MSEC Conference in Greenville, South Carolina, 23-27 June 2025. This annual event aims to inspire innovative manufacturing ideas and foster long-term advancements in US industrial competitiveness. Organized in collaboration with the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the competition will showcase visionary concepts that challenge the status quo and identify transformative research directions in manufacturing. The competition invites 6-8 finalist teams to present bold, interdisciplinary ideas addressing grand challenges in advanced manufacturing. Presentations focus on Technology Readiness Level/Manufacturing Readiness Level (TRL/MRL) 1-3, aiming to influence US manufacturing research and education through groundbreaking proposals. Participants will engage with NSF program directors, academic and industry leaders, and policymakers to foster innovation and technical collaborations. Key features include a comprehensive dissemination strategy, such as video testimonials, webinars, and social media outreach, to ensure lasting impact. With an anticipated attendance of 100 participants, the competition will directly shape the future careers of researchers, educators, and practitioners in manufacturing. The event fosters the development of human resources essential for sustained innovation in advanced manufacturing. Dissemination of finalist and winner presentations through various channels will expand awareness of these visionary ideas, influencing policymakers, federal agencies, and industry leaders. Ultimately, this competition strengthens US industrial competitiveness by catalyzing support for transformative research and fostering a robust manufacturing ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Sky Competition drives the identification and articulation of high-impact research directions that extend beyond the scope of single investigators. By emphasizing radical, unconventional, and disruptive ideas, the event encourages the convergence of disciplines and the exploration of transformative solutions. Previous competitions have demonstrated the ability to advance knowledge and elevate emerging concepts to national and international prominence, with examples including in-space manufacturing \r\nand bioprinting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
