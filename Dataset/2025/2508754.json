 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project contributes to HBCU-UP program goals by infusing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) into architectural engineering and mechanical engineering curricula to address a national need to strengthen engineering education and better prepare students for careers in high-demand sectors such as aerospace, energy, and national security. CFD is a critical tool for addressing complex thermal fluid challenges that are central to applications ranging from aircraft design to energy systems to data center cooling. Yet, many undergraduate engineering programs lack structured opportunities for students to develop CFD proficiency, leading to a disconnect between academic preparation and industry expectations. Through a learn-apply-develop-contribute pathway, this project strengthens students\u2019 foundational knowledge in fluid mechanics while providing hands-on experience with real-world engineering challenges. This approach allows students to gain essential skills such as problem-solving, computation, and critical thinking, while also enhancing students\u2019 workforce readiness.\r\n\r\nThe project vertically integrates CFD into courses such as Fluid Mechanics, Advanced Mechanical Systems, Fluid Dynamics, Thermal Fluid Systems Design, Heat and Air Conditioning, and Capstone Design. To ensure comprehensive CFD integration, the PIs developed an Integrated Multimodal Learning Framework, strategically incorporating cross-grade peer learning, flipped classroom, and project-/problem-based learning, tailored to the unique demands of each topic. CFD training materials support this framework and include video modules, example projects, and online assessments. CFD projects are designed in collaboration with industry partners, bringing real-world challenges into the classroom to enhance career readiness through collaborative learning and project-/problem-based learning approaches. Virtual and augmented reality are integrated with CFD simulations to improve conceptual understanding and increase student engagement through immersive visual learning. The project includes ongoing data collection and evaluation to assess student learning outcomes, engagement, and the effectiveness of the Integrated Multimodal Learning Framework. Findings inform iterative improvements to the framework and contribute to broader educational research on CFD integration. This project is expected to contribute positively to student motivation and retention, while offering a model for integrating advanced computational tools into STEM coursework using the adaptable Integrated Multimodal Learning Framework and producing a new generation of engineers to undertake global challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
