 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project researches the development of a comprehensive framework that ensures the principled use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in data-intensive education research. The framework will benefit society by enabling more trustworthy education research, fostering public confidence in AI applications, and ensuring that technological advances serve all students. The project provides insights on responsible AI practices in education research and supports education by creating publicly available training materials for researchers and others with varying technical backgrounds.  \r\n  \r\nThe project aims to bridge the gap between high-level principles and practical implementation by developing a responsible and principled framework for data-intensive education research in the AI era. The framework targets three key stakeholder groups: data administrators who manage access to education data; researchers who use education data to perform analysis; and individuals who are deciding whether to participate in research studies. The project uses a mixed method study with all three stakeholders to understand their current practices, concerns, and decision-making processes regarding education data usage. Based on these insights, the project team will develop and deploy a novel web-based assessment tool that leverages state-of-the-art responsible AI techniques to detect potential risks within datasets, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about data sharing and usage. Additionally, the project team will create a toolkit that identifies bottlenecks from the community and translates complex AI risks and benefits into accessible formats, utilizing interactive visualizations to facilitate understanding among non-technical stakeholders. Finally, the team will develop comprehensive educational support materials, including video tutorials, interactive modules, and real-world case studies that demonstrate principled AI practices in education research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
