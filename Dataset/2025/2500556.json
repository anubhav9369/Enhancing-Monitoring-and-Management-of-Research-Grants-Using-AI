 "awd_abstract_narration": "Piedmont Community College (PCC) is located a short distance from Research Triangle Park. The Triangle Region has a diverse business ecosystem with over 7,000 companies across multiple industries including Agtech, Cleantech, Life Sciences, Advantaged Manufacturing and Technology, and the region's industries are witnessing a surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. This trend has driven a significant demand for a skilled technical workforce with the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) identified by industry for entry-level technicians. This project will develop industry-aligned curricula at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity benefiting two-year college students, faculty members, and local industry stakeholders. Working in partnership with local industry, PCC will provide students the KSAs to earn industry recognized credentials and gain hands-on learning experiences. The project will bridge the gap between academic education and real-world application and increase the number of individuals with specialized skills and advanced technical knowledge in AI and cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance PCC's technical education programs by (1) recruiting, training, and credentialing highly qualified faculty; (2) developing an interdisciplinary curriculum with new courses culminating in an associate's degree and stackable certification program; and (3) offering students opportunities to learn practical skills in hands-on labs, capstone projects, and internships. The industry-informed curricula will include Prompt Engineering, Generative AI, AI Policies, Ethics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, AI and Cybersecurity Tools, and AI Governance. Work-based learning will be prioritized to ensure students gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills to meet employer needs and drive innovation in the rapidly evolving AI and cybersecurity fields. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy. Instructions for the abstract are above the template box in e-jacket.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
