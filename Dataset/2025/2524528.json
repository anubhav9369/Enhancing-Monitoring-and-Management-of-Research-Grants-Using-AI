 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of innovative solar evaporation technology for small satellite propulsion. Traditional methods commonly rely on solar electric propulsion, where solar energy is converted into electricity before being transformed into thrust. These systems are limited in their energy conversion efficiency, and the thrust-to-power ratio is relatively low. This technology addresses these limitations by directly converting solar energy into thrust via a photothermal process. This improvement significantly increases efficiency, enabling a more powerful and cost-effective propulsion system for satellites, which is crucial for reducing launch costs and space requirements of satellite missions. Moreover, the system is compatible with renewable and non-toxic propellants, lowering costs, safety risk, and environmental harm. The widespread adoption of this technology could increase satellite mission capabilities while increasing safety and sustainability, supporting the growth of space exploration and habitation as well as advanced navigation.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution represents the development of a high-efficiency, low-cost, solar evaporation method based on the ability for interfacial photothermal evaporation to concentrate solar energy at the surface of a porous material and use capillary action to draw water from the bulk to the heated surface. Solar energy is thus directly converted into thermal energy with a conversion efficiency of 85%, significantly surpassing the 50% efficiency of existing solar panels. Moreover, the direct solar-to-thermal conversion reduces energy loss, resulting in more efficient propulsion systems with a superior thrust to power ratio compared to traditional methods. The technology is compatible with abundant, inexpensive, and non-toxic propellants, such as water or ammonia. This advanced technology has the potential to revolutionize space propulsion by making satellite missions more cost-effective, sustainable, and capable of supporting a wide range of applications, from communications to Earth observation and deep-space exploration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
