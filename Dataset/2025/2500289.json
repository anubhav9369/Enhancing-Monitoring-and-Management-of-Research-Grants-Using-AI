 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics learning is often viewed as a sequential and cumulative process, where each stage builds upon the previous one. A crucial part of this progression is the development of formal fraction knowledge. Previous studies indicate that students develop understanding of fraction concepts as early as first grade. The project aims to help schools integrate fractions more effectively into the primary mathematics curricula, before formal fraction instruction occurs. The work aims to bridge the gap between the emphasis on whole numbers in preschool and early elementary education and the focus in later grades on fractional quantities. The research will study how fraction-related activities appear in first and second grade mathematics and how activities can be developed to support students' learning about fractional quantities alongside whole numbers.\r\n\r\nThis research will enhance understanding of the nature of early mathematical cognition, particularly regarding non-integer quantities, in several significant ways. It will investigate for the first time the nature of the input in the school environment that may support early fraction knowledge. Additionally, the project will refine assessment methods for measuring this knowledge and examine how targeted fraction activities can further promote growth in this area. To study the learning environment, the approach will be to analyze textbooks and interview teachers. The next phase of the study will examine learning activities in a longitudinal study including an experiment to test the impact of the fraction learning activities on early fraction knowledge and mathematics achievement. This combined approach will contribute to describing the current state of fraction-related learning activities and develop meaningful approaches that can be used to teach fraction concepts in the early grades.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
