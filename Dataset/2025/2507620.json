 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to commercialize a novel paint and primer system that manages indoor moisture and suppresses mold growth, with an initial focus on residential and commercial bathrooms. Mold exposure in buildings is a significant health and economic issue, contributing to respiratory illnesses and extensive maintenance costs. This innovation offers a passive, affordable, and easily retrofitted solution for improving indoor air quality and preventing costly moisture damage. By reducing the latent load on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, the coatings can also enhance energy efficiency. This project will increase the economic competitiveness of the United States by strengthening domestic manufacturing, creating a new high-value export category, and stimulating innovation in the built environment. The technology is designed to deliver broad-based benefits to Americans across all regions and housing types. Commercially, this effort targets a significant opportunity within the $60 billion global decorative coatings market, with an estimated multi-billion-dollar addressable segment in moisture-prone spaces. Successful deployment could shift market expectations by embedding high-performance functionality into standard architectural coatings.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a multi-functional coating system that combines high-capacity moisture storage with directional vapor transport (mimicking a \"vapor diode\") to protect building assemblies from water accumulation. The innovation integrates hygroscopic and thermally responsive materials into a two-layer coating architecture\u2014a primer and a topcoat\u2014that modulate moisture dynamics in response to environmental conditions. The research objectives include validating the system\u2019s effectiveness in suppressing mold-supportive humidity levels, quantifying thermal and moisture buffering effects, and modeling the system\u2019s performance in various climates and installation scenarios. The project will involve field pilots in real-world buildings, controlled pre- and post-application testing, and the collection of longitudinal humidity and condensation data. These results will inform the refinement of physical models that predict mold risk behind walls and ceilings, providing deeper insights into hidden moisture dynamics. Through this research, the project will advance understanding of passive moisture control in building materials and lay the foundation for a new class of functional architectural coatings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
