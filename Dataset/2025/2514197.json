 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national interest by creating a collection of earth and space science laboratory investigations designed to increase the scientific literacy of undergraduate non-STEM majors. Each investigation is carefully crafted to emphasize the nature of science and progressively increase the level of scientific inquiry expected from students. Through this approach, the curriculum supports students in understanding the process of science, learning key earth and space science concepts, developing scientific skills, and gaining confidence and interest in STEM. The collection represents a significant contribution to undergraduate education by being specifically designed for two-year college students, both online and in person, without requiring specialized equipment. Importantly, the approach supports implementation across institutions regardless of available funding, resources, or instructional modality. In addition, the project strengthens undergraduate STEM education by sharing the collection and underlying approach with educators nationwide and offering training on effective implementation and adaptation. Ultimately, the project fosters the development of opportunities for students to become engaged, competent, critical consumers of scientific information.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) advance innovation in earth and space science courses at two-year colleges, 2) promote the success of non-STEM majors at two-year colleges by improving scientific literacy, and 3) ensure two-year college faculty have evidence-based resources to effectively engage with non-STEM majors. To meet these goals, the project seeks to create, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a collection of laboratory investigations designed for asynchronous online or in-person use. These investigations are developed and piloted at partnering institutions located on opposite coasts of the country. The design framework guides the development process and is expected to be refined throughout the project and ultimately shared with the broader geoscience education community. An advisory board supports all aspects of the project, provides regular feedback to strengthen implementation, and oversees assessment and evaluation activities that employ multiple measures to examine students' scientific literacy and understanding of scientific concepts. Dissemination efforts focus on broadly sharing the curriculum throughout a widely used repository and offering professional development that prepares faculty to implement the materials in their own context. The NSF IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Program seeks to accelerate and advance knowledge about the impact of emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
