 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\nSemiconductor materials, devices, and computing must be optimally co-designed, with simultaneous consideration of elements across the technology chain. The benefits of co-design to advance semiconductor technology have been widely recognized in a variety of government and industry studies. A holistic, co-design approach can more rapidly create high-performance, robust, secure, compact, energy-efficient, and cost-effective solutions. \r\nMeeting Topics:\r\nTopic 1: Collaborative Research in Domain-Specific Computing\r\nTopic 2: Advanced Function and High Performance by Heterogeneous Integration\r\nTopic 3: New Materials for Energy Efficient, Enhanced-Performance and Sustainable Semiconductor-Based Systems\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nThe Future of Semiconductors (FuSe2) Awardees Workshop will foster communications among FuSe2 awardees, the industry partners (Intel, Micron Technologies, Samsung, and Ericsson), and NSF program officers through a combination of context setting presentations by the industry partners, presentations from awardees in the three FuSe2 topics, and unstructured discussions. This meeting will take place over 2 days on September 22 and 23, 2025, at the National Science Foundation headquarters. The format of the meeting will foster communications through a combination of context setting presentations by the industry partners, presentations from awardees in the three FuSe2 topics, and scheduled time for awardees to have unstructured discussions. The meeting will be co-chaired by Nadia El-Masry (NSF/ENG/EEC), Yaroslav Koshka (NSF/MPS/DMR), and X. Sharon Hu. About 75 participants will attend the meeting. Participants will be FuSe2 awardees, representatives of the FuSe2 industry partners, and NSF staff representing participating directorates, including the Semiconductor Working Group.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
