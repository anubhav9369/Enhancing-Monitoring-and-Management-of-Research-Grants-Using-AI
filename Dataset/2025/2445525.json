 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Developing and Testing Innovations project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers by engaging youth in the participatory design of artificial intelligence (AI) exhibits. As AI rapidly reshapes society and the workforce, today's youth must be given opportunities to build AI literacy so they are prepared to become active participants in the AI-powered future workforce. This project will empower up to 100 youth, ages 13-18, to become AI Innovators who will collaboratively create interactive AI exhibits. These exhibits will ultimately be featured in a public science museum, allowing broader audiences to explore AI principles and applications. As youth iteratively design the exhibits, they will explore the inner workings of AI, build technical know-how, strengthen their STEM identities, and develop interest in emerging AI career paths. The project will produce an easy-to-adopt model for other museums and after-school programs to expand access to AI/STEM workforce development and promote community engagement with rapidly evolving AI technologies.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative initiative--led by The Lawrence Hall of Science in partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of San Leandro--aims to equip a cohort of high school aged-youth with foundational AI competencies for AI-related futures, co-design personally meaningful AI exhibits that engage the wider public, and provide replicable strategies that informal science institutions can use to build accessible and , engaging AI learning programs. The project research will utilize mixed methods to examine the impacts of participatory co-design of AI exhibits on youth outcomes, specifically focusing on their AI literacy and skills, and their dispositions toward AI and related careers. In addition, design-based research methodology will be used to systematically and iteratively refine a co-design model that will identify design practices that foster AI literacy, technical skill development, and exploration of AI career pathways for youth in STEM learning programs. Collectively, the research will generate insights into how to create effective AI learning experiences that increase participation in AI pathways. Findings will inform the development of impactful AI education strategies to equip students with essential AI skills and competencies to become the next generation of American AI innovators. The project will produce adaptable models for informal science education settings, aiming to support the creation of more innovative science learning environments, thereby contributing to a more AI-ready workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
