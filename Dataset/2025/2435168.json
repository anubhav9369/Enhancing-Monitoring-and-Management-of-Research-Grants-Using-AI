 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports US-based graduate students and postdocs to attend and participate in the international conference and summer school \u201cArithmetic and p-adic geometry in Chile\u201d in December 2024 (https://hdc-g.github.io/agchile2024/index.html). Arithmetic and number theory is the study of properties and patterns in the integers. These questions are deep, and geometric tools have emerged as a powerful structure that helps us understand them. Often, this geometry is not the usual Euclidean geometry, but a p-adic one in which distance is governed by divisibility properties of a prime number p such as 2, 3, 5. There have been fundamental recent advances in the theory of p-adic geometry, and the impact of those advances on questions in arithmetic is only just beginning to be understood. This conference will bring together experts in arithmetic and p-adic geometry to share their work and explore connections between these fields. The early career participants funded by this award will learn the newest developments from experts, enabling them to carry these ideas into their burgeoning research. Moreover, the location of the conference, in Santiago, Chile, will facilitate collaborations between mathematicians in the northern and southern hemispheres.\r\n\r\nBoth the summer school and the conference will be organized around three themes: p-adic L-functions and Iwasawa theory, the p-adic Kudla program, and the p-adic Langlands programs. These are three active areas of number theory research where the recent advances in p-adic geometry are already making an important impact. These three areas also have important connections with each other. By bringing together experts in all of these fields, the conference will facilitate a sharing of knowledge and a flowering of new collaborations coming from different perspectives on the complicated objects studied in p-adic geometry. Participating in these conversations will be especially beneficial for the early career participants funded by this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSummary: The grant supported the participation of 11 US-based graduate students and postdocs at the graduate summer school and international conference \"Arithmetic and p-adic geometry in Chile\", which took place at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile from December 213, 2024. Specifically, it supported their travel, accommodation, and meal expenses associated with attending the conference and summer school. All of them had the opportunity to display a poster featuring their research at the conference.\n\nIntellectual Merit:The summer school and conference addressed three themes: p-adic L-functions and Iwasawa theory, the p-adic Kudla program, and the p-adic Langlands programs. These themes were chosen for their connections to p-adic geometry, a field that has experienced enormous progress in recent years. By bringing together experts in all of these fields, the event facilitated a sharing of knowledge and a flowering of new collaborations coming from different perspectives on the complicated objects studied in p-adic geometry.\n\nThe summer school consisted primarily of four lecture series, each four lectures long, on topics related to the themes. The courses were on condensed mathematics, singular moduli for real quadratic fields, p-adic distribution and Hecke orbits, and higher Hida and Coleman theory. The courses were given by Juan Esteban Rodriguez, Andrew Graham and Giada Grossi, Jan Vonk, and Sebastian Herrero, respectively.\n\nThe conference featured 17 speakers from both hemispheres who have recently made progress on one of the themes. Selected speakers include Pierre Colmez, Lennart Gehrmann, Isabella Negrini, Hector Pasten, and Eric Urban.\n\nBroader Impacts: By supporting the participation of early career researchers, this grant contributed to training the next generation of mathematicians. The workshop exposed the students to the latest techniques and advances in the field and allowed them the chance to learn and ask questions from leading experts. They also had the opportunity to present a poster about their research, thereby expanding their research network and profile.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JaclynALang\n"
