 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is an expanding multidisciplinary field that draws on expertise from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering. It promises applications in computing, sensing, and networking. Just as the computing sector did not stop research and development with the first integrated circuit, QISE will continue to evolve beyond small-scale devices, and is expected to prompt new discoveries and innovation across all of science and engineering. Employers in this domain have indicated a persistent need for a quantum-ready workforce with varying levels of proficiency in concepts, hardware, theory, experiment, and more. Aligned with this, quantum education has expanded over the last five years, but the future of implementation remains uncertain and unstable compared to education in other critical technologies like artificial intelligence. This project curates, develops, and disseminates ready-to-go quantum learning materials, and supports cohorts of educators in every state to develop QISE knowledge. This project also provides crucial information on viable methods for adapting quantum education to different localities. The project leverages members of the National Q-12 Education Partnership and explores a model for multi-sector collaboration on developing the domestic quantum-ready workforce.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: This project utilizes a robust network of professionals to introduce tens of thousands of pre-college students to quantum information science and engineering topics, future applications, and career information. The central feature of the project is \u2018quantum-in-a-box,\u2019 inspired by both private and public sector science and engineering programs connecting students with activities. Specifically, the project builds upon QuanTime, a project that encourages educators to dedicate one class period to quantum science. This was initially piloted as a quick-turnaround response to community input and currently disseminates one-off quantum activities to educators. The project aims to reach at least 500 teachers across the United States. Typically, each teacher instructs 100-150 students per year, demonstrating a powerful multiplier. The project explores the feasibility of scaling quantum education through local implementation, and contributes knowledge to the discipline by (1) Designing and distributing quantum materials with input from National Q-12 Education Partnership and wider educator community,  (2) Expanding the distribution network for QuanTime, leveraging employers, (3) Supporting implementation with educator office hours,  and (4) Collecting and analyzing data on implementing quantum education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
