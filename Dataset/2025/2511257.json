 "awd_abstract_narration": "The orbits of planetary systems hold clues about their origins. Gas giants like Jupiter are thought to form on circular orbits far from stars. However, exoplanets with large eccentricity abound, and the \u201chot Jupiter\u201d class have orbital periods of just a few days. In some cases, extremely eccentric planets may approach their stars, where tidal forces deform them, dissipate energy, and ultimately circularize their orbits\u2014a hypothesis known as high-eccentricity migration (HEM), which is the likely origin of many hot Jupiters. This project focuses on the physics of \u201cwarm Jupiters,\u201d which orbit far enough from their stars to avoid strong tidal forces yet are too close to have formed in place, also suggesting a migratory origin. Their orbital properties inspire new projects that this team, from Indiana University and Northern Arizona University (NAU), is pursuing. They will provide research opportunities and training of new astronomers at both institutions, making project software publicly available, and hosting a new Spanish-language public lecture series at NAU. \r\n\r\nThis work tackles a recent puzzle: the origin of eccentric warm Jupiters. One of the strongest pieces of evidence of HEM is the misaligned orbital planes of many hot Jupiters relative to the equator plane of their host stars, but eccentric warm Jupiters are typically aligned. To potentially explain this trend, this study pursues in-depth modeling of planetary systems: (a) coplanar high-eccentricity migration with a dynamical tidal treatment, (b) the influence of inertial waves on obliquity damping, and (c) the role of disk gaps in resonant capture and escape. Through gravitational interactions between planets, between planets and the disk, tidal energy dissipation, and population synthesis \u2013 this project uses the puzzle of warm Jupiters as a springboard to elucidate many issues in planetary dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
