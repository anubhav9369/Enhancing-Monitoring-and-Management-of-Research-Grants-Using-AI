 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research examines the factors that drive the efficacy of irrigation system management in addressing water scarcity and soil salinity. By expanding our understanding of the interaction between humans and water and soil resources, the data will provide novel insights into resource management and resilient agricultural production. Investigators specifically look at the connections between social network structures and local irrigation management, and test for the variables that explain differences among individuals within the social network. In addition to training a student in anthropological science and expanding the scientific workforce in understanding the relationship between advanced irrigation system management and the bioeconomy, broader impacts include widespread dissemination of water management best practices to stakeholders. Additionally, this award supports investigators in an EPSCoR jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nResearch findings make important contributions to social network analysis and the scientific understanding of human adaptation to resource use. The focus on advanced irrigation management techniques and expands our knowledge in advanced manufacturing with the capacity to improve the efficiency and productivity of food production. In addition to improving scientific understanding of the relationship between irrigation management and the bioeconomy, results have the capacity to translate the findings into practice to improve civic water engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
