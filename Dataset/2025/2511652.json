 "awd_abstract_narration": "The separation of small molecules by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC or LC) and identification of the molecules by mass spectrometry (MS) has aided organic, analytical, and natural products chemists for 40 years (LC-MS). This technique has improved greatly over that time so that a nonexpert can get useful information about a compound with much less effort.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of a low-resolution LC-MS impacts the training of a future generation of chemists, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college. This LC-MS would be incorporated into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, used by undergraduates participating in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU \u2013 CHE2447813) and the Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences (UCARE) program. Beyond the undergraduate mission, this LC-MS will aid in training graduate students, who will use it independently for their research. Many will use LC-MS in their first job after leaving UNL. This LC-MS will drive the research of routine users and increase the knowledge of instrumentation for our undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows. This will be done through a combination of lectures on LC and MS, as given by experts at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in these fields, and a workshop or practicum in which students are given practical experience in working with these methods on the new LC-MS system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
