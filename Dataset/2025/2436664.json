 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data science is a transformative field that has impacted virtually every aspect of society. Providing widespread data science education is essential for cultivating a skilled and engaged workforce while ensuring national competitiveness in this rapidly growing domain. This project is a collaboration between the University of Chicago, Olive-Harvey Community College and Middle College High School, Gary Comer Educational Campus, Chicago State University, and Xchange Chicago to establish pathways to data science learning and careers for youth on Chicago's South Side. The work will focus on engaging youth in the community with the goal of increasing their understanding of data science and to increase the number of individuals prepared to work in data science related fields. Over the duration of the project, the partners will build a South Side ecosystem, deepen partnerships, and implement improvements informed by ongoing evaluation.\r\n\r\nFour pathway entry points will be created: a) high school after-school programming; b) high school introductory data science courses; c) community college data science certificate; and d) university-level data science minor and major. This project includes assessments of the student learning and evaluations of program activities. Each partner will leverage the others' assets to co-create programs with four common elements: a) aligned data science content; b) experiential projects; c) explicit attention to ethics; and d) guidance on pathway progression. Assessed learning objectives represent content areas including data literacy and the data science lifecycle, coding, and foundational mathematics and statistics. Data will be collected through rubrics, questionnaires and interviews. Through these efforts, the project will address critical gaps in data science education and provide real-world learning opportunities while contributing to the development of a competitive and skilled national workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly sponsored by the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings and the Division of Undergraduate Education within the Directorate for STEM Education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
