 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a national need for a skilled workforce in semiconductor manufacturing by providing undergraduate participants with immersive learning experiences in plasma engineering and materials processing. As semiconductor applications expand across industries such as computing, telecommunications, automotive, and defense systems, workforce preparation in this area is critical to national innovation, economic competitiveness, and technological leadership. By introducing participants to applied engineering, materials science, and real-world problem solving, the project strengthens the STEM pipeline and connects learners to future-facing career opportunities. The project enhances the capacity of academic institutions to prepare students for pathways into technical fields such as semiconductor manufacturing, plasma engineering, and advanced materials processing. The project engages participants from three university campuses in structured, scaffolded learning that builds from foundational technical skills to advanced plasma system design, materials characterization, and process optimization. Participants gain hands-on experience in plasma reactor operation, materials analysis, computational modeling, and process control, and apply these skills to real-world challenges such as semiconductor device fabrication and quality validation. The program features a cohort-based model that fosters peer collaboration and continuity of learning. Faculty and graduate student mentors provide technical coaching and guidance on academic and career pathways. Industry partners support participant development through feedback, design reviews, and exposure to engineering standards used in semiconductor manufacturing. Workshops at industry facilities and research laboratories and certification opportunities further immerse participants in STEM environments and expand their understanding of professional opportunities. The project aligns with industry workforce needs and offers insight into multiple career paths, including direct workforce entry and advanced technical roles. Outcomes will be assessed through participant engagement, skill development, mentor involvement, and career placement tracking, creating a replicable model for expanding access to STEM careers and advancing national workforce priorities. The ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
