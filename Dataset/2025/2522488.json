 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests whether simple, novel social activities like storytelling, improvisation, or light-hearted conversations can help the brain stay sharp and boost thinking skills in older adults. Early findings show that these moments improve memory, attention, and mood. This project examines brain activity, body responses, and thinking ability before and after such interactions to understand effects on the aging brain. The goal is to turn scientific discoveries into easy-to-use tools that caregivers and community programs can use to support healthy aging. The project advances translational science by applying cutting-edge brain research to real-life challenges and training caregivers in how to incorporate these activities into their work.\r\n\r\nThis research project investigates how brief social interactions affect brain function and cognitive performance in older adults. Using advanced brain imaging techniques (3T and 7T functional MRI), the researchers study how such interactions influence the brain\u2019s salience network, which helps people notice and respond to important information. It also explores how interactions affect the way this network connects with other brain systems related to attention, language, and movement\u2014connections that tend to weaken with age. Physiological responses, such as pupil size, skin conductance, and heart rate, are measured to understand how alertness and emotional engagement may contribute to cognitive benefits. In addition, the project examines how these interactions activate brainstem regions involved in releasing noradrenaline (locus coeruleus) and dopamine (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area), which are key neurochemicals for motivation and attention. By linking changes in brain activity and physiology to improvements in attention, memory, and verbal fluency, the project aims to uncover how social interactions promote cognitive flexibility in later life. These findings guide the development of simple, low-cost interventions for use in caregiving and community settings, making the project a strong example of translational science that turns neuroscience into real-world solutions for healthy aging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
