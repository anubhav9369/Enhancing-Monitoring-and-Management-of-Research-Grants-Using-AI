 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Ping Lu of Rowan University and Professor Cheng Zhang of Long Island University are studying innovative approaches to create long-lasting and highly efficient catalysts for critical industrial chemical processes. Catalysts are essential materials that accelerate chemical reactions, enabling the production of fuels, chemicals, and other vital products. However, under the harsh conditions of industrial environments, catalysts often degrade, losing their effectiveness and requiring frequent replacement, which increases costs and environmental impact. This project will focus on developing advanced catalysts that are designed to withstand these challenging conditions while maintaining superior performance. By improving catalyst durability and efficiency, particularly for processes that convert carbon dioxide into valuable products like fuels and chemicals, this research will pave the way for cleaner energy production and more sustainable industrial practices. Additionally, the project will engage students in hands-on research, providing them with valuable training in state-of-the-art scientific techniques. Through a collaborative summer research program, students will gain practical experience, develop professional skills, and prepare for careers in science and technology. This initiative will foster partnerships between Rowan University and Long Island University, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and expanding opportunities for the next generation of scientists and engineers to contribute to impactful scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Ping Lu of Rowan University and Professor Cheng Zhang of Long Island University are studying the design, fabrication, synthesis, and characterization of nanofiber-encapsulated bimetallic catalysts to overcome the persistent challenge of catalyst deactivation in gas-phase reactions. The project will address catalyst deactivation by developing catalysts with enhanced stability and activity through two innovative strategies: first, encapsulating active metal sites within porous nanofiber matrices to create physical and chemical barriers that prevent sintering, a process where metal particles aggregate and lose effectiveness; and second, introducing spatially defined gradients in metal composition and loading to suppress coke formation, a carbon buildup that clogs catalytic sites. The research will leverage cutting-edge techniques, such as programmable triaxial electrospinning, to precisely control catalyst structure, alongside a comprehensive suite of characterization methods, including electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and spectroscopy, to probe atomic interactions and electronic structures. These efforts will provide molecular-level insights into deactivation pathways and catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. The project will yield more robust and efficient catalysts for carbon dioxide conversion processes, such as hydrogenation and dry reforming of methane, which are critical for sustainable chemical production. By advancing the fundamental understanding of catalyst stabilization, the research will contribute to the development of greener catalytic technologies, with potential applications in the energy and environmental sectors. The outcomes will also strengthen the scientific community\u2019s knowledge base, influencing future catalyst designs and fostering interdisciplinary advancements in catalysis science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
