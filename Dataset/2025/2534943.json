 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quantum Education and Policy Summit is a workshop meeting designed to foster strategic coordination across the national quantum education and workforce development landscape. Education and workforce development in quantum information science (QIS) is important because it enables cutting-edge research in several areas of science and engineering, and fosters talent that will be needed in many high technology industries of the future. The summit will convene educators, administrators, and workforce leaders to identify challenges, share best practices, and reduce duplication of efforts in building the quantum talent pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Education and Policy Summit is scheduled for August 6-8, 2025, in Washington DC. Speakers will be drawn from the quantum education community with a focus sharing a range of perspectives across industry, education, and workforce development and highlight specific, successful models from the US and international partners. This event will bring together faculty and colleagues from a network of NSF-funded Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI) and other efforts aligned with the National Quantum Initiative to explore pathways to realize added value from coordination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
