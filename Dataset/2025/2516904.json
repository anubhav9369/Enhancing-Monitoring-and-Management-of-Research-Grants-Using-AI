 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Partnership Development & Planning (type 3) project is for the libraries of the Northern Mariana Islands to strengthen partnerships and relationships that leverages existing collaborations with the Space Science Institute. The purpose of this partnership project is to continue the forward progress and set the stage for future work in collaboration between libraries and Space Science Institute, as well as support the libraries in acquiring funding resources.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) Identify other organizations and individuals to partner with, 2) provide existing and new partners with information, training, and resources to acquire STEM education funding, and 3) build capacity for continued and future collaborative partnerships through funding and research. This project will utilize a variety of deliverables which include community dialogues, asset mapping, library showcases, as well as training related the acquisition of funding, and basic evaluation and research methods. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing everyone multiple pathways for accessing and engaging in STEM learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
