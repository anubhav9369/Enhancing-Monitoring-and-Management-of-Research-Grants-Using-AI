 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving how student learning is measured and supported within introductory physics courses, key gateway courses for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Traditional multiple-choice question formats in these courses often provide limited information to instructors, limiting their ability to adapt their instruction to the specific needs of their students. This Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project plans to explore the effectiveness of using multiple-choice questions presented in alternative formats to increase student learning and information available to instructors while preserving the efficiency and scalability of traditional multiple-choice questions.\r\n\r\nThe project plans to investigate the effectiveness of three alternative multiple-choice formats in communicating students' partial understanding and improving conceptual learning in introductory physics. Specifically, this project aims to 1) characterize the problem-solving strategies introductory physics students use to answer alternative multiple-choice questions, 2) develop a series of pre-class videos that include embedded alternative-format multiple-choice questions for nationwide use in physics, 3) measure how students perform on alternative multiple-choice questions relative to traditional multiple-choice questions in high-stakes settings, and 4) produce evidence-based guidelines and best practices for physics instructors wishing to use these alternative multiple-choice formats in their courses. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
