 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saint Mary\u2019s College seeks to develop an innovative institutional assessment, conducted in collaboration with a consortium of peer institutions, that will be used to inform the development of an action plan to elevate the College's research focus. This planning project involves a rigorous evaluation plan to assess existing research infrastructure, bolstered by evaluations undertaken by partner institutions, to inform recommendations for expansion of the College\u2019s research capacity. The results of the evaluation will be used to create a plan to expand research support infrastructure to facilitate institutional and collaborative proposal planning and submission, which will in turn be shared with peer institutions in the Midwest to create a mutually supportive consortium that centers resource-sharing and collaboration to enable the full participation of undergraduates in the scientific process. Through building this collaborative environment, this project seeks to advance knowledge and serve as a model for successful interdisciplinary and inter-institutional partnerships, ultimately contributing to a richer, more nuanced understanding of critical issues affecting research at institutions with a primarily undergraduate student base\r\n\r\nSaint Mary\u2019s College has recruited St. Catherine\u2019s University and Alverno College to participate in the new consortium. With this grant, Saint Mary\u2019s will hire an external evaluator to develop a survey instrument and analyze the data generated. The evaluator will conduct a needs assessment using a mixed methods approach integrating qualitative and quantitative data from various sources including extant data analysis, surveys, interviews, observations, and document review. Two goals shape this proposal: 1) Assess Saint Mary\u2019s internal research infrastructure in relation to a goal of increasing research resources for faculty and students, and to assess the consortium partners\u2019 research infrastructure needs; 2) Analyze the data generated from the Saint Mary\u2019s assessment and synthesize it with the partners\u2019 results to inform an action plan to address identified needs. The data that will be gathered and analyzed during this project will enable the research team to determine opportunities to share resources and collaborate cross-institutionally, with an emphasis on supporting the needs of undergraduates in research and increasing research opportunities for students and faculty across the consortium. A strategic engagement plan will be utilized to share this model with other PUIs throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
