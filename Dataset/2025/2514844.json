 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the translation from lab to market of an assistive communication device that adapts to the context of the user in real-time. The innovation includes features such as incorporation of the user\u2019s location, conversation partners, and current conversation topics, as well as biosensors to detect the user\u2019s emotions so it sounds like natural human speech. This solution addresses issues related to current assistive communication devices, which can be tedious to learn and use, and sound like robots, resulting in the abandonment of 60% of devices in the first year. The commercialization of this innovation has the potential to benefit society by o\ufb00ering advanced communication options for users, simplifying the learning process, lowering device abandonment rates, and giving voice to millions of people of all ages.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of an assistive communication device that that can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and biosensor data to easily adapt to the context of the user. The scientific advances that make this solution di\ufb00erent from existing solutions include the use of AI, geolocation, identification of high frequency words in the conversation, and biosensor data. The benefits of this approach include providing the user with an easier and improved communication experience that could improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
