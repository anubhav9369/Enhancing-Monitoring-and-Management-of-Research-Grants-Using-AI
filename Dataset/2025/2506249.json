 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Division of Chemistry Research Instrumentation program, and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Strategic Initiatives. The University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled broadband probe to support the research of Professor Dong-Chan Lee, along with colleagues Pradip Bhowmik, Ernesto Abel-Santos, Jun Yong Kang, and Chandrabali Bhattacharya. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of organic materials, polymer chemistry, synthetic chemistry methodology, battery, and biomedical chemistry. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument has significantly enhanced sensitivity owing to the cutting-edge cryoprobe technology compared to a standard room-temperature probe, which not only ensures the timely success of the ongoing projects but fosters opportunities to explore new research projects. This instrument enhances the educational, research and research training of students at all levels including K-12 outreach and students at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and the neighboring Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) Institutions. This state-of-the-art NMR spectrometer strengthens the infrastructure of UNLV which is in an EPSCoR state. In addition, more collaboration opportunities are envisioned within NSHE institutions, especially with Nevada State University and College of Southern Nevada, both undergraduate serving institutions in close proximity.\r\n\r\nResearch enabled by this instrument is focused on 1) the characterization of materials with low solubility (polyaromatic nanoribbons, high molecular weight ionic polymers, and polymeric C-O) and complex molecules with minute quantity; 2) the elucidation of reaction mechanisms via in-situ real-time reaction monitoring; 3) studying small molecule-protein binding dynamics using ligand-observed NMR techniques for disease diagnosis and therapy; 4) investigating ionic transport properties in ionic liquids using Pulsed Field Gradient NMR that are important for battery applications; 5) understanding molecular self-assembly by identifying leading intermolecular interactions. The upgraded variable temperature capability significantly improves characterizing highly viscous polymers and controlling reaction rates for real-time reaction monitoring. In response to global helium supply challenges, the acquisition of this instrument includes a superconducting magnet with a low loss cryostat reducing the institution\u2019s consumption of helium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
