 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participants in the Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference to be held at Texas A&M University during May 16-18, 2025. The Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference series is one of the most important venues for researchers in the field of several complex variables and has influenced generations of researchers at all career stages.  This year\u2019s conference will be held for the first time at Texas A&M University and will provide an excellent opportunity for graduate students and early-career researchers to learn about the latest techniques and trends in several complex variables.  The conference program includes lectures by leading researchers as well as early-career mathematicians, a poster session for graduate students, and an open problem session for conference participants.  More information can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/mwscv2025/home.\r\n\r\nThe Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference at Texas A&M University will showcase recent developments in several complex variables, functional analysis, operator theory, complex geometry, and related fields. The main topics of this year\u2019s meeting include the Cauchy-Riemann operator, the complex Laplacian, and their applications; the Kohn Laplacian and CR geometry; reproducing kernels and invariant metrics; function theory in several complex variables; and the interplay between several complex variables and operator theory.  These areas have witnessed significant progress in recent years.  The conference will bring together leading experts, early-career researchers, and graduate students in several complex variables and related fields to discuss these recent developments and explore new research frontiers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
