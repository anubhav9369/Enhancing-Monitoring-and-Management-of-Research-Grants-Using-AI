 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. manufacturing sector is rapidly digitizing through the adoption of additive manufacturing (AM), the integration of cyber-physical systems, and the shift toward smart manufacturing. As manufacturing systems become increasingly connected and software-driven, innovation in processes and materials must be matched by robust cybersecurity measures to ensure system reliability, data integrity, and operational resilience. To meet these evolving demands, there is a need to create programs that train undergraduate students to address the growing shortage of engineers and scientists working at the intersection of advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity. This REU Site at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, will recruit 10 undergraduate students each summer from 2026 to 2028 for a 10-week research and professional development program, drawing participants from across the country, including those from 2-year and 4-year colleges with limited access to research infrastructure in these fields. Students will work on structured, hands-on research projects of their choice at the intersection of advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity, mentored by OSU faculty conducting research in these areas. Students will also engage with industry professionals, manufacturing entrepreneurs, and national lab researchers through webinars and networking events. They will receive training in scientific writing, communication, and research methods, and will be guided by domain experts on pursuing graduate education or careers in these fields. Student research outcomes will address current, high-impact challenges in their chosen area, while the broader activities will support their development as future contributors to the advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this REU Site are to: (1) prepare students to perform independent research in AM and cybersecurity by immersing them in hands-on projects spanning bioengineering, energy storage, aerospace, and construction, as well as projects focused on securing interconnected AM systems; (2) promote interdisciplinary collaboration through lab meetings, peer engagement, and group activities; (3) broaden students\u2019 understanding of AM\u2019s societal and industrial relevance by facilitating interactions with researchers at national labs, entrepreneurs, and OSU alumni in the manufacturing sector; (4) strengthen students\u2019 professional skill sets through structured workshops on ethical research, scientific communication, and graduate school preparation; and (5) support students\u2019 long-term success in STEM by providing individualized mentoring, networking opportunities, and continued guidance beyond the program. Students will have opportunities to present and share their research findings through oral and poster presentations at the end-of-program REU Symposium, inclusion in final research reports submitted to faculty mentors, and potential dissemination through campus events or conference participation facilitated by the program. Program effectiveness will be assessed through pre- and post-program surveys, mentor evaluations, and focus group interviews, and student career trajectories will be tracked over time. Evaluation findings will be shared through education conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and relevant STEM education networks.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
