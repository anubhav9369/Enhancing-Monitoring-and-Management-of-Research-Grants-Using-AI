 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a scalable and reliable method for domestic saffron production. Saffron, one of the world\u2019s most expensive spices, faces significant production challenges due to its high cultivation costs, sensitivity to weather conditions, and labor-intensive harvesting process. By reducing dependence on foreign supply chains and mitigating risks from crop failures, this innovation has the potential to stabilize global saffron availability and pricing. The project will benefit both consumers and businesses that rely on saffron, while strengthening U.S. leadership in advanced agricultural biotechnology and specialty ingredient manufacturing. Beyond saffron, this project also helps advance scientific understanding of how to grow complex plant tissues in the lab. The work combines cell culture, plant biology, and manufacturing innovation to build a platform that could be used for other rare plant-based ingredients in the future. In doing so, it promotes growth in the emerging field of cellular agriculture, supports the U.S. economy through domestic production and job creation, and strengthens supply chain resilience for natural products.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to revolutionize saffron production through the development of lab-grown Crocus sativus stigma tissue. The approach involves cultivating Crocus sativus callus cells in suspension culture, followed by integrating them with a scaffold for immobilized culture. The cells will be extruded within a hydrogel into an elongated shape and induced to differentiate into stigma-like tissue expressing secondary metabolites, mimicking the structure of natural saffron threads. The development of a specialized scaffold will enable suitable cell adhesion and controlled plant tissue growth leading to an increase in the production of the valuable metabolites that give saffron its characteristic color, taste and bioactive functions. This novel culture system and differentiation method for Crocus sativus cells will facilitate the production of saffron that is nearly indistinguishable from traditionally grown threads. The objective is to create a scalable, cost-effective, and climate-resilient method for saffron production that ensures consistent quality and supply while significantly reducing costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
