 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tennessee CHIPS STARS project at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is creating pathways for high school teachers and students to engage with microelectronics and semiconductor technologies. Aligned with national investments in chip design and manufacturing, the program supports the growing demand for a skilled U.S. workforce in these critical sectors. It brings together university researchers, local schools, and industry partners to offer an industry-aligned curriculum, hands-on learning experiences, and paid internships. Over the project\u2019s duration, 20 STEM teachers will be trained to deliver cutting-edge content, reaching over 1,000 students. Through lab tours, guest speakers, and experiential learning, the initiative strengthens the talent pipeline from high school to careers\u2014positioning Tennessee as a leader in advancing the nation\u2019s microelectronics workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project responds directly to the national call for a robust semiconductor workforce by creating scalable, high-impact pathways from high school to industry. This three-year initiative combines intensive teacher training, a standards-aligned microelectronics curriculum, and authentic industry experiences with partners such as Texas Instruments, Siemens, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The program will train 20 high school STEM and Career Technical Education (CTE) teachers to deliver flexible, problem-based modules grounded in real-world applications. Over 1,000 students will engage in classroom projects, with 45 selected for paid summer internships. Students can also earn industry-recognized micro credentials through a new dual-enrollment model. Core deliverables include a sustainable implementation framework, open-source curriculum resources, and a statewide network of trained educators. Rigorous evaluation will assess gains in educator capacity and student interest in microelectronics careers, positioning Tennessee as a leader in the semiconductor talent pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields. This project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
