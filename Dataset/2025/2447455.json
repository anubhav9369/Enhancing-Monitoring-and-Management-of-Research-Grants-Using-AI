 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) opportunity at Iowa State University aims to broaden participation in aerospace engineering by engaging high-potential undergraduate students in hands-on research and professional development. Titled Launching Aerospace\u2019s Undergraduates into the Next Chapter \u2013 Space Technology (LAUNCH-SPACE), the program seeks to foster student interest in graduate studies and careers in aerospace through immersive, mentored research experiences in cutting-edge space technology.\r\n\r\nParticipants will benefit from a structured 10-week summer program that includes five core components: (1) collaborative research projects, (2) professional development workshops, (3) field trips and lab tours, (4) research luncheon seminars, and (5) social and networking events. Recruitment efforts will focus on identifying qualified candidates from a range of institutions, including community colleges and universities across the country. The program emphasizes academic merit, research potential, and student interest in aerospace as key selection criteria. By offering meaningful research experiences and mentorship in a supportive academic environment, LAUNCH-SPACE will contribute to the national effort to develop a highly skilled and innovation-driven STEM workforce prepared to address the complex challenges of space technology and exploration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
