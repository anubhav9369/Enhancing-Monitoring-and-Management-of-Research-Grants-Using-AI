 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on a novel method to extract lithium from low-grade liquid sources, including geothermal and oilfield brines. Existing extraction methods are expensive, inefficient, and environmentally destructive, often involving high water use, long processing times, and hazardous chemicals. As the global demand for lithium accelerates due to the world-wide electrification of transport systems, conventional lithium extraction practices remain insufficient to unlock domestic reserves. This solution offers a more economical and sustainable alternative by eliminating chemical inputs, reducing freshwater usage, and cutting production costs. By enabling lithium production from previously untapped sources, the technology supports national goals of strengthening the domestic mineral supply chain, reducing environmental harm, and advancing economic and energy security.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an electrochemical process that directly extracts lithium by selectively capturing ions from complex liquid sources. The system integrates advanced materials and reactor architecture to enable rapid, chemical-free extraction with high efficiency and low cost. In contrast to membrane or ion-exchange approaches, this method requires no acid regeneration and operates with minimal water and energy inputs. By engaging with stakeholders across the mineral recovery value chain, the project identifies technical requirements, application-specific use cases, and supply chain considerations essential for scaling. This effort supports broader national objectives by unlocking American resources, reinforcing the domestic supply chain, and accelerating progress toward critical mineral independence and long-term energy security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
