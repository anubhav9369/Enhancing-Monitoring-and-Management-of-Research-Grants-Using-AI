 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing photocatalysts that can convert carbon dioxide to a beneficial carbon feedstock has become an important research subject in chemistry. Photocatalysts use sunlight to transform raw materials into valuable products with minimal impact on ecosystems. In this project, Professor Psaras McGrier at The Ohio State University (OSU) is preparing metal-free photocatalysts using an advanced class of crystalline porous polymers. These photocatalysts can be used to convert carbon dioxide to chemical fuels and value-added products using visible light. Professor McGrier is utilizing several education and outreach programs at OSU to engage students from the local Columbus (Ohio) City School District in STEM activities. These activities include participation in the Breakfast of Science Champions (BoSC), an OSU program that allows middle school students from these local schools the opportunity to visit and learn more about various cutting edge research projects. Professor McGrier is also co-directing and mentoring students from the OSU Chemistry and Biochemistry (CBC) Post-Baccalaureate Bridge Program, which offers significant program assistance to post-baccalaureate students to help prepare them for a Ph.D.\r\n  \r\nIn this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Psaras McGrier at The Ohio State University (OSU) is developing metal-free donor-acceptor and organic hydride-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that can initiate the photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide using visible light.  The goal is to obtain metal-free COF-based photocatalysts that can convert carbon dioxide to chemical fuels and value-added products in a selective manner. Such investigations will help supplement the carbon cycle and reduce environmental concerns in a more sustainable manner. This proposal includes several education and outreach programs to help increase the participation of young students in STEM fields. These activities include participation in the Breakfast of Science Champions (BoSC), an OSU STEM program that allows middle school students from Columbus City Schools the opportunity to visit and learn more about various cutting edge research projects. Professor McGrier will also co-direct and mentor students from the OSU Chemistry and Biochemistry (CBC) Post-Baccalaureate Bridge Program, which offers significant program assistance to post-baccalaureate students to help prepare them for a Ph.D.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
