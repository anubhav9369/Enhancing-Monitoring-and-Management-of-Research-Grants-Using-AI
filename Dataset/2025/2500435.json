 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving curricula in mining technician education to align training with innovations in the mining industry. The College of Western Idaho will establish a mining technician Associate of Science (MINE A.S.) degree program to prepare graduates to fill technical career openings in the high-demand mining and geosciences industries. With the re-emergence of domestic critical mineral mining to support the nation\u2019s shifting industrial landscape, there is a growing need to train students to use state-of-the art mining and surveying tools and equipment, such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), lidar, UAVs (uncrewed aerial vehicles), and various surveying, drilling, and water testing tools. The project will serve the NSF mission and public interest by advancing understanding about how to effectively prepare community college students for the technical demands of the mining industry through coursework, fieldwork, and faculty development. The project will support regional economic development by re-introducing mining technician training in partnership with local and regional employers, nurturing relationships between academia and industry to equip A.S. graduates with the scientific, technical, and professional skills mining employers seek. The industry-aligned project will offer direct pathways into mining industry technician-level jobs leading to industry certifications that prepare all students to enter well-paying jobs.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to establish a MINE.A.S. program. Objectives are to (1) enroll three cohorts of students (50 to 60 over the project period); (2) train faculty in the uses and course integration of industry-standard mining and surveying equipment; and (3) build partnerships with Idaho mining employers to provide all MINE.A.S. students with significant hands-on training experiences. Key activities will include purchasing and integrating industry-aligned mining and surveying equipment into several geological sciences, environmental sciences, and engineering courses; developing two new MINE.A.S. courses (Mining Capstone and Survey Engineering); implementing a MINE.A.S. outreach and recruitment strategy; providing a yearly faculty development series led by industry experts; establishing a new MINE.A.S. Industry Advisory Technical Advisory Committee; and adding employer-paid summer internships. All graduates will complete the requirements to obtain Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) certification and enter mining careers. Project evaluation will assess, inform, and disseminate learning about the essential components of course curricula and fieldwork to prepare the technician-level mining and geological sciences workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
