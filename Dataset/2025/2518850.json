 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by integrating responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) principles into undergraduate engineering education. The project will address the growing need to equip future engineers with both technical knowledge and ethical awareness necessary to design AI technologies that are socially responsible and aligned with public values. This Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project will provide structured and applied learning experiences in responsible AI, with a particular focus on high-impact areas such as healthcare. It will implement an interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum that blends technical instruction with ethical frameworks. Key contributions include the establishment of the Healthcare Ethics and AI Learning (HEAL) Lab to support collaborative, research-based learning and a strong institutional partnership between Chapman University and the University of Texas at El Paso, expanding participation and knowledge exchange. By grounding ethics within applied, technical contexts, the project will advance the understanding of national models for integrating responsible AI into undergraduate engineering education and generate new knowledge about effective instructional practices for cultivating ethical awareness and agency in the next generation of engineers.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are framed by two core research questions: (1) How can integrating ethical AI practices into undergraduate curricula improve students\u2019 ability to design socially responsible AI systems? and (2) What is the impact of collaborative, research-driven learning on engineering students\u2019 understanding and application of AI ethics in real-world projects? To answer these questions, the project plans to integrate responsible AI modules into existing data science and engineering courses, create opportunities for interdisciplinary research through HEAL Lab, and offer a hands-on technical seminar series to strengthen students\u2019 technical and ethical competencies. Additional outreach activities, including a summer camp for high school students, will broaden participation and promote early engagement with AI and STEM disciplines. A combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation will be used to assess learning outcomes, student attitudes, and the effectiveness of instructional strategies. Findings will be shared through open-access materials, workshops, and scholarly publications. By embedding ethical reflection within applied AI learning experiences, this project will contribute new insights into how undergraduate engineering education can foster socially responsible innovation. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
