 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site on Accessible Information and Communication Technology (AICT) at Gallaudet University engages a group of students with a range of auditory abilities in human-centered research experiences that investigate the accessibility of information and communications technologies (ICT).  As ICT becomes more pervasive, a crucial challenge is to provide a high quality user experience to people regardless of their auditory abilities, by training the next generation of people who have diverse auditory abilities. \r\n\r\nStudents will learn about accessible ICT, engage in the research process from ideation to presentations, and join a community of scholars and practitioners who will provide career advice and mentorship. The REU projects will form the basis for new collaborations among the investigators and other collaborators at the students' home institutions. The teams of undergraduate and faculty/staff researchers with diverse auditory abilities increases recognition of the range and complexity of needs by users with diverse auditory abilities and possible ICT solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
