 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research with the primary objective to establish an approach for Design for Product Evolution (DfPE) considering the dynamic nature of customers' preferences, and how they are affected by the information received through their social network. The central hypothesis is that a computational framework for DfPE can be accomplished by integrating dynamic models of decision-making at multiple resolutions, specifically, Decision-Field Theory (DFT) for individual level customer decision-making, and spreading dynamics at the population level to model the influence of social networks on the customer demand. The research objective will be achieved by pursuing three thrusts: (1) Extending the DFT-based model to a multi-decision framework, (2) Modeling the demand dynamics for evolving products inspired by networked epidemic models, and (3) Integration of multi-resolution models for optimal design for product evolution. The research outcomes will be validated using real data and through collaboration with industry partners. The computational methods developed in this project will enable concurrent design of marketing campaigns and agile product development strategy considering the dynamic nature of preferences, competition, changes in technology, and changes in supply chains resulting from new regulations.\r\n\r\nThe project will equip engineering design practitioners and systems engineers with computational tools that reflect real-world complexities such as evolving user preferences, social influence, and rapid technological advancement. These tools will help engineers design more adaptable and user-responsive products\u2014especially critical in industries where updates and iteration are continuous, such as AI-enabled autonomous systems, consumer electronics, and mobility solutions. Additionally, the project team will create an online game for learning how to design for product evolution. The game will simulate product design in dynamic markets, providing an engaging platform for both classroom learning and public science outreach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
