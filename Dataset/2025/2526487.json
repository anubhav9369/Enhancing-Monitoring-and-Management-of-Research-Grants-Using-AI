 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) project is to support research on developing and piloting 3D digital models of homes for simulating how extreme heat behaves indoors and outdoors. Built out of collaboration with local households, these models look to help identify areas most affected by heat and allow testing of different solutions, such as shading, ventilation, or material upgrades. Extreme heat is one of the deadliest natural hazards in the United States, and its impacts are intensifying due to urban expansion. In neighborhoods like Westside in San Antonio, Texas, many homes -- especially those built before modern energy codes -- lack proper insulation and cooling systems, making them vulnerable during prolonged periods of high temperatures. This project looks to create a shared platform for residents and city partners to explore retrofit options, assess energy use, and make informed decisions about home improvements. By connecting scientific tools with real-world decision-making, it aims to demonstrate how translational research reduces disaster risks and supports long-term planning in housing and infrastructure. It seeks to serve as a model that other neighborhoods can adapt to similar challenges. \r\n\r\nThis pilot project implements and evaluates co-creation of digital twins for enrolled homes in San Antonio\u2019s Westside neighborhood. Digital twins are 3D, data-enriched models created using low-cost LiDAR sensors via smartphones and validated with professional-grade scanners. Each home is equipped with indoor and outdoor temperature sensors to capture real-time heat data. These data then drives high-resolution thermal simulations using SimScale for indoor airflow and comfort and ENVI-met for outdoor microclimate modeling. Two key hypotheses are tested, namely that, (1) digital twins support better co-design of heat-resilient retrofits, and (2) coordinated outreach improves access to existing home repair and energy-saving programs. Three project phases include digital modeling, collaborative retrofit planning via a new digital platform, and implementation of targeted upgrades. Surveys, interviews, and sensor data are analyzed to evaluate effectiveness. Deliverables include a simulation platform, a home retrofit toolkit, and guidance materials that can be shared and scaled to other cities and housing markets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
