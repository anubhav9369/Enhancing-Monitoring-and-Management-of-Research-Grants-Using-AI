 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zeolites are a class of naturally occurring minerals and synthetic materials that are well-known for their use in catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange applications. The International Zeolite Association recognizes 258 different types of zeolite frameworks.  Commercial applications only use about 10% of the known zeolite structures; the majority of commercial uses employ variations on only five major zeolites. Because of their promise and their need for further optimization in the field of sustainable catalysis, the existing library of potential materials needs to be expanded. This project investigates the use of a class of zeolites with non-traditional chemical compositions. These chemical elements often create unusual structural features that cannot be made using traditional zeolite synthetic methods. As a result, a better understanding of the role these novel elements play in creating new zeolites will lead to the development of unique materials for catalytic applications including biomass conversion to energy. The research is also expected to promote community college students to attain undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe interzeolite transformation method uses a zeolitic source of silica and alumina (the parent material) to form a different zeolite framework of interest (the child zeolite).  This project will study the role of the heteroatoms in determining interzeolite transformation phase selectivity and will focus on the unique bond angles, bond lengths, and the stability of the heteroatoms compared to aluminum. The phase selectivity will be studied by first synthesizing heteroatom-containing parent zeolites and subsequently using these materials in interzeolite transformation reactions.  Several different parent zeolite structures will be used to understand the relative effects of the parent structure versus heteroatom.  Materials characterization, density functional theory calculations, and zeolite structural analysis will be used to analyze the synthesis results. The insights gained from this work will impact the broader field of new zeolite materials development, and the synthesis products will be used in future biomass and hydrocarbon isomerization catalysis studies.  Moreover, the mechanisms that occur during interzeolite transformation nucleation and crystallization are not well-understood. Better comprehension of these processes will lead to new methods of synthetic control, such that zeolites are obtained with the desired properties for the applications of interest.  Catalysis of sustainable feedstocks and local environmental issues specific to the San Jose, California metropolitan area will be incorporated into environmental modules for K-14 students. The goal is for these students to pursue STEM degrees so they can tackle critical environmental topics that affect their communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
