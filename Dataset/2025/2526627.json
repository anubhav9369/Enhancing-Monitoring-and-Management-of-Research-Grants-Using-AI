 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) project is to support research on prototyping, deploying, and testing data-driven analytics to improve efficiency, availability, and affordability of carshare services. The Cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota launched the EV Spot Network in collaboration with HOURCAR, the largest nonprofit carshare provider in the US. The EV Spot Network provides publicly owned electric vehicle carshare and chargers. The service is projected to grow significantly over the next three years. This scale-up poses challenges that have not been adequately addressed in academic literature or practice. The research-centered pilot deploys data-driven analytics, developed by the research team, that look to support HOURCAR in making decisions as it seeks (a) densification of its service, (b) expansion of its service region, and (c) extending the reach of public transit. Specifically, partnering with HOURCAR and its stakeholders, the research team aims for real-world deployment of (1) a demand estimation engine, (2) a network design engine, (3) a pricing and incentive design engine, and (4) an operations planning engine. \r\n\r\nThe research project looks to contribute fundamental knowledge for how community-based carshare can be scaled up. It will prototype, deploy, and test a suite of data driven decision support tools. It will also evaluate the effectiveness of various behavioral modification interventions and incentives that can promote the use of carsharing. The research-centered pilot allows the team to answer key questions, including 1) what the drivers of demand are for community carshare; 2) how a community carshare shall go about balancing the needs for efficiency, availability, and affordability; and 3) what the features of incentives are in inducing greater carshare usage and mitigating the spatial and temporal mismatch between vehicle supply and demand. If successful, this pilot can serve as a template for how community carsharing can be scaled up in a cost-effective way while improving availability, increasing affordability, and extending the reach of public transit. It can also serve as a blueprint for how cities, transit authorities, and community-based organizations can partner together to bridge the gap between essential resources and services and community needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
