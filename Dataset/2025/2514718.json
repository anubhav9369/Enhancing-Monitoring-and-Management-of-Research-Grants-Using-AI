 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) and the Engineering Research Centers (ERC), this project aims to facilitate a center for ultrawide bandgap semiconductor device materials and education.  The project plans to combine semiconductor materials fabrication, processing, and characterization strategies along with modern Artificial Intelligence (AI).  The researchers will focus on ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors for next-generation devices operating at high power, high frequency, and under extreme conditions (temperature, radiation, corrosion, etc.).  The center will also train and develop the next generation of technology leaders comprised of graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.  The project is part of a strategic goal of sustaining and developing research capacity to be a leading research institution in the UWBG semiconductor field within this decade.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the research are interconnected via three subprojects.  First, implement new fabrication, processing, and doping strategies to produce novel UWBG heterointerfaces.  Second, develop new scanning probe microscopy based UWBG characterization techniques to interrogate UWBG heterointerfaces.  And third, develop UWBG material aware AI-based models to investigate materials and heterostructures.  UWBG semiconductors are an emerging class of materials for future technological demands of tremendously large power handling capacity and high switching speed for high power electronics. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. The Engineering Research Centers program supports collaborative, interdisciplinary research partnerships between universities and industry to advance engineered systems, drive technological innovation and cultivate a globally competitive engineering workforce for significant societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
