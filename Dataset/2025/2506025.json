 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Ramesh Jasti of the University of Oregon will explore new ways to design and build \u201ccarbon nanohoops,\u201d a unique type of molecular ring made entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a circle. These molecules have unusual electronic and optical properties that make them promising building blocks for future technologies. This work aims to broaden the utility of nanohoops in optoelectronic materials and provide fundamental insight into how molecular design governs the properties of strained pi-systems. In addition to the scientific goals, this work will provide training opportunities for students at all levels and support outreach programs that introduce young learners to science. \r\n\r\nThis research will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of donor-acceptor (D\u2013A) substituted [n]cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and related nanohoops to understand how electronic modulation alters their photophysical properties and supramolecular interactions. Systematic variations in nanohoop size and D\u2013A substitution patterns will be used to tune emission wavelengths, quantum yields, and solubility. The team will also investigate how these modifications influence host\u2013guest chemistry, with a particular focus on generating strongly bound ring-in-ring complexes using pi\u2013pi donor\u2013acceptor interactions. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies, complemented by computational modeling, will guide the understanding of structure\u2013property relationships.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
