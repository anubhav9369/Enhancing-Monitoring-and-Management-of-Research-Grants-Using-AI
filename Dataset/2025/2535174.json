 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a sensor to detect phosphorous levels in water. Excess phosphorus in water resources is a major contributor to harmful algal blooms and eutrophication (nutrient enrichment), which threatens ecosystems, drinking water safety, and agricultural sustainability. Current phosphorus testing methods are often expensive, slow, and unsuitable for field use. This technology uses a composite material that provides accurate and real-time detection of phosphorus compounds with strong resistance to environmental interference, making it suitable for field deployment. The technology is designed to address the growing need for portable, affordable, and reliable detection tools. The goal is to enable early and accessible phosphorus detection in lakes, rivers, and runoff sites. This sensor technology may provide a solution to critical gaps in current phosphorus detection technologies in multiple sectors, including agriculture, wastewater management, industrial discharge monitoring, municipal water utilities, and private well systems. Stakeholders in these sectors could use the technology to monitor phosphorus levels leading to enhanced public health, reduced ecological damage, and support of data-driven nutrient management practices.\r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a nanocomposite material-based electrochemical phosphorus sensor. The technology is an electrochemical phosphorus sensor that utilizes screen-printed electrodes modified with a nanocomposite material. The low-cost electrodes are modified with a blend of reduced graphene oxide, polypyrrole, and ammonium molybdate, which are applied via drop-casting and electrochemical deposition on the electrode surface. The sensor detects phosphorus using open-circuit voltammetry by measuring shifts in the electrical potential caused by the selective binding of phosphorus ions at the modified electrode surface. The sensor demonstrates a detection limit as low as three parts per trillion with strong linearity and stability. Importantly, the sensor exhibits excellent selectivity, enabling it to effectively distinguish phosphorus from other interfering chemicals commonly found in water samples. These characteristics make it highly suitable for environmental and industrial water quality monitoring applications. This technology may provide a low-cost, ultra-sensitive phosphorus sensor for real-time environmental monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
