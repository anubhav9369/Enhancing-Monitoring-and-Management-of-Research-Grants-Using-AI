 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the concept of successful aging among Alaska Native Elders in four communities in the Interior and Southeast regions of the state. Building upon previous successful research, the PI will employ a community-based participatory approach to define and document what aging successfully means to Elders and to evaluate the impacts of care facilities on Elders\u2019 experiences. This research will advance understanding of aging in the fields of gerontology and community health; produce recommendations to promote successful aging in local communities; and present alternatives to perceptions that equate aging with poor health and immobility.\r\n\r\nWorking collaboratively with local tribal councils in Fairbanks, Galena, and Juneau, the PI will establish an Elder Advisory Council to oversee all phases of the project. Data will be collected using survey instruments and in-depth qualitative interviews with Elders from the Interior and Southeast Alaska. The PI will present findings and receive feedback from communities at several stages in the research process. Broader impacts include opportunities for student research and training; increased participation of Alaska Native communities in setting research agendas; development of partnerships among communities, care facilities, and researchers; and advancing understanding of successful aging in different cultural and geographic contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Elders emphasize the importance of passing down cultural heritage, language, and practices to younger generations to ensure these vital elements are not lost. Community involvement is crucial, with Elders encouraging younger individuals to engage with their communities and uphold traditional values. Additionally, maintaining well-being through active living, proper nutrition, and spiritual practices is highlighted as essential for successful aging, or aging in a good way. Respect plays a central role in relationships, with Elders encouraging younger generations to understand its significance in fostering positive interactions within the community. However, the challenges of modernization, the introduction of tv, internet, and cellphones, present a concern, as traditional practices may be threatened.
