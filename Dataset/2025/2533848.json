 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2025 Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis, held October 10-12, 2025 at Purdue University Fort Wayne.  The conference advances research in the field of mathematical analysis by offering a venue for dissemination of results and building cooperation among researchers in various disciplines, especially those represented in the Midwest. An emphasis is placed on introducing graduate students, early career faculty, and other young researchers to a wide range of current problems, techniques, and results.  The conference features a poster presentation to foster networking among all attendees.  More information can be found on the conference webpage http://mwaa.math.indianapolis.iu.edu/.\r\n \r\nTopics covered by the conference include complex analysis, several complex variables, potential theory, approximation theory, and applications.  The workshop convenes researchers in these disciplines with the goal of stimulating new mathematical interactions among them. Exposure to current work across disciplines allows for new mathematical and professional connections to be made.  Presentation of cutting-edge results and building collaboration are the goals, which contribute to the professional development of all attendees and is especially valuable for early-career researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
