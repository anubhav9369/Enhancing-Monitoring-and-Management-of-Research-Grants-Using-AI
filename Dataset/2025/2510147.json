 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support for projects that create and advance theory driven models and innovations addressing efforts to promote student success and retention in STEM at HBCUs. This project investigates the impact of student support programs on the academic success, retention, and degree completion of undergraduate engineering students. Engineering plays a pivotal role in addressing national challenges and driving innovation. Enhancing persistence in engineering education is a key priority for strengthening the STEM workforce. This research project studies the impact of structured support initiatives\u2014such as mentoring, collaborative learning, and academic resources\u2014on the student experience. The goal is to identify practices that foster community, academic confidence, and engineering perceptions, while also accounting for differences across institutional contexts. Findings will inform efforts to improve support strategies and promote success across all engineering student populations. \r\n\r\nThis two-year, mixed-methods study utilizes quantitative methods to assess the impact of support program participation on academic performance, retention, and degree completion. Outcomes are compared across subpopulations related to institutional setting and context. Qualitative methods are used to explore students' perceptions on the impact of the learning environment, with a focus on faculty ownership and agency, science perceptions, and academic confidence. Results of this study will offer actionable insights to institutions seeking to enhance engineering education and student success in engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
