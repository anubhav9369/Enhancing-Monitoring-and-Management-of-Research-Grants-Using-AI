 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern information systems struggle to connect related data across organizations, making it difficult to solve complex national challenges that require insights from multiple sources. Knowledge graphs have emerged in many domains of science and technology as a powerful means of integrating, structuring, and mining information to extract new knowledge. Recognizing the importance of this paradigm, the National Science Foundation initiated the Prototype Open Knowledge Network program to build a prototype version of an integrated data and knowledge infrastructure called the Open Knowledge Network. As a federated but interconnected set of knowledge graphs, the Open Knowledge Network would support knowledge discovery across a wide array of application domains and would allow researchers and policymakers to see connections and patterns that are invisible when data remains isolated in separate databases. This project develops the essential foundation that enables different knowledge graphs to work together seamlessly, serving the national interest by supporting evidence-based policymaking, strengthening economic competitiveness through data-driven innovation, and accelerating scientific breakthroughs that address complex challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Open Knowledge Network is envisioned as a national data infrastructure designed to empower users. The project will foster novel developments in three key areas: First, knowledge graph interoperability and the application of knowledge backgrounds to enable seamless data integration across domains. Second, the applicability of different federated query technologies under different circumstances to optimize data access and retrieval. Third, the use of natural language interfaces to interact with structured knowledge, making complex data accessible to broader audiences. The research activities include developing data and knowledge management systems, implementing federated query capabilities, and creating advanced artificial intelligence tools. The work is a key component in moving the Prototype Open Knowledge Network from its nascent state to a fully functioning public release. Through ongoing engagement with stakeholders to ensure responsiveness and transparency, the project will facilitate greater access to reliable knowledge for the public, empower researchers to discover new insights across disciplines, and accelerate the development of powerful models that help address complex challenges facing the nation while supporting economic growth and leadership in artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
