 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Hispanic-Serving Institutions: Enriching Learning, Programs, and Student Experiences (HSI:ELPSE), this Implementation and Evaluation Project (IEP) Level 1 project aims to increase retention, academic achievement, and career preparation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates by connecting first-year and transfer students with academic support, professional development, and early research opportunities. Many students begin their STEM studies with strong motivation but may encounter academic challenges in their first year at a 4-year college that can affect their progress toward graduation and readiness for STEM careers. This is important because supporting students at this pivotal stage can help more undergraduates complete their degrees and contribute to the growing need for STEM professionals. The project will offer a series of academic success workshops, a service-learning course in STEM leadership, and opportunities for students to participate in faculty-mentored undergraduate research. Through these activities, students will build confidence, develop essential skills, and engage more deeply with their STEM education. The project seeks to increase retention and graduation rates, enhance academic performance, and strengthen preparation for STEM careers, with a particular emphasis on transfer students. Transfer students are especially vulnerable to academic probation\u2014a risk compounded by their advanced standing, which affords them less time to access and benefit from institutional interventions before graduation. Effectively supporting transfer students at this pivotal stage is crucial for improving degree attainment and addressing the growing demand for STEM professionals. Moreover, the project will provide a model for other institutions seeking to support student success in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this project are to increase retention, academic achievement, and preparation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers among first-year and transfer students by providing academic success workshops, a service-learning course in leadership, and early opportunities for faculty-mentored undergraduate research. The project will also support faculty and postdoctoral mentors with training in effective undergraduate research mentorship. The research will examine how participation in these activities influences student retention, academic performance, and confidence in scientific skills. The project will use a combination of validated surveys, institutional data, and mentoring assessments to measure outcomes for participating students and mentors. Results are expected to show higher student retention and graduation rates, improved academic performance, and increased engagement in research and leadership activities. Project findings and best practices will be shared through presentations at professional conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and a project website, providing a transferable framework for other institutions seeking to support student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This project is funded by the Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at Hispanic-Serving Institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
