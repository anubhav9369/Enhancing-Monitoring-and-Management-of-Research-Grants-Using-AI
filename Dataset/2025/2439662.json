 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving students' skills in collaboration and teamwork in the context of learning physics. Physics classes often involve group work, but without guidance, teamwork may break down. This project will teach students to communicate and support each other so that they can learn more effectively together. These teamwork skills will help prepare the students for success in the workforce. This work is supported as a Level 2 project in the Engaged Student Learning track of NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EDU) program.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to strengthen collaborative learning in physics by teaching teamwork skills. The investigators aim to develop and test a classroom intervention using the framework of socio-metacognition, which provides communication and reflection practices to support productive teamwork. The intervention will consist of five coordinated, research-based activities: reading, case-study analysis, composing a team charter, reflecting on classroom experience, and action planning. The intervention will be implemented in three physics courses -- a calculus-based course for scientists and engineers, a course for future K-8 teachers, and a pedagogy course for undergraduate teaching assistants -- at two different institutions, Western Washington University and California State University, Chico. The investigators will explore how the teamwork instruction impacts students' teamwork skills and group dynamics. They will also conduct faculty workshops to share instructional materials, gather feedback, and support the adoption of teamwork instruction in STEM classrooms. The education research will address questions such as the following: How well do students understand what effective teamwork looks like before and after the teamwork instruction? How often do students use productive teamwork behaviors, and does teamwork instruction help them use these skills more consistently? Does the teamwork instruction improve students' attitudes toward teamwork? How do students navigate group dynamics during moments of confusion, and does this improve with the teamwork instruction? The NSF IUSE: EDU program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
