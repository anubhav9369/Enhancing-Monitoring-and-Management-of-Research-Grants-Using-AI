 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an autonomous robotic system for inspecting hazardous industrial infrastructure in flammable and explosive environments. Many facilities in the energy and chemical sectors rely on infrastructure such as storage tanks, pressure vessels, columns, boilers, and pipelines to operate safely and efficiently. These assets degrade over time, requiring regular inspections that help plan necessary repairs to prevent leaks, emissions, fires, or other failures. However, current methods are dangerous, expensive, and inaccurate, often requiring shutting down of critical systems to make ready for human inspection, emitting greenhouse gases in the process. The proposed innovation allows for in-service inspections, which completely eliminates the need for confined space entry and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This technology supports environmental compliance and enhances workplace safety while delivering high-resolution data that can improve maintenance planning and reduce downtime. Its broader impact lies in transforming inspection practices across high-risk infrastructure, paving the way for more sustainable and automated industrial operations.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a wall-climbing robotic platform designed to conduct autonomous inspections inside hazardous, explosive environments\u2014such as those commonly used in the process industries. The project will address seven core technical objectives: (1) develop advanced navigation systems to safely traverse complex and sludge-laden steel structures; (2) develop an automated data collection and inspection reporting system that integrates visual, LiDAR, thermal, gas concentration, and tactile / contact-sensing data; (3) test and refine the robot\u2019s various safety protection methods to allow operation in explosive atmospheres; (4) enhance deployment and retrieval methods for efficient field operation; (5) finalize the design and management of a robot-attached umbilical lifeline; (6) refine product design and field operations through field surveys and customer input; and (7) accelerate industry adoption through pilot projects and regulatory engagement. Together, these efforts aim to deliver a fully certifiable, deployable robotic inspection tool capable of transforming how industrial facilities inspect and maintain their most hazardous infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
