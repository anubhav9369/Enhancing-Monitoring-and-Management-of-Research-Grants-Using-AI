 "awd_abstract_narration": "The medium-energy nuclear experimental program planned by the Ohio University group aims to answer the questions: \u201cHow does subatomic matter organize itself inside a proton or neutron?\u201d and \u201cAre the fundamental interactions relating to the structure of proton or neutron fully understood?\u201d These research areas were framed as outstanding challenges to modern physics in the 2023 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science. The PI\u2019s research focuses on studying the internal structure of protons and neutrons. The strong force, one of Nature\u2019s four fundamental forces, governs this internal structure. The PIs will also investigate the limits of our understanding of Nature\u2019s fundamental forces by seeking physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. They will work with an electron beam colliding with hydrogen, deuterium, and other nuclear targets at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). Principal Investigators Roche and King, three graduate students, and one undergraduate stu- dent, will perform the research supported by this award. The program has multifold broader impacts, including training the next generation of scientists and engaging the public through STEM education for High School students.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio group will analyze the data from the JLab NPS-RG1A experiment, which completed data taking in the Spring of 2024, and contribute to the study of the internal structure of the nucleon using the Generalized Parton Distribution framework. In addition, the group will use their data acquisition and software development expertise to complete the preparation of the JLab MOLLER experiment and participate in the data- taking expected to occur during this funding period. Finally, the group, in collaboration with Dr. Korover\u2019s group from Tel Aviv University, will work toward demonstrating the feasibility of the streaming readout system necessary to support data acquisition rates expected for the upcoming JLab TDIS experiment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
