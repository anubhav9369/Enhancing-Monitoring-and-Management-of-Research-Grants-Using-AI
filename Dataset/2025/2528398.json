 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Fast-Track project is to make advanced 3D display technology easier and safer for students to use. The team is creating the first student-friendly optical trap display (OTD) system using tiny lights called micro-LEDs. Unlike older versions that needed lasers and safety gear, this version is safe for classrooms. Through a program called \u201cHunt for the Hologram,\u201d students will do real research by finding particles that can be trapped with light and using them to create floating images in the air. This helps students build skills like spatial reasoning and problem-solving. The new technology also costs less and is easier to use, with potential for wide use in STEM education and future uses in fields like medical imaging and micro-manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will investigate whether micro-LED arrays can provide bright, independent illumination to multiple optically trapped particles in partial vacuum, overcoming technical limitations of laser-based systems. Phase I will optimize particle trapping (target: 20+ stable traps), evaluate brightness (target: 200+ nits per particle), and validate user experience through design-based research. Key innovations include using spatial light modulators and holographic optical elements to direct micro-LED light to specific 3D positions, allowing multiple viewers to observe floating images. Phase II will develop a portable, compliant, and manufacturable prototype, aligned with educational standards and safety regulations. Technical milestones include transitioning from laser to micro-LED illumination, increasing trap density, and verifying user-perceived image quality. Successful completion will enable future commercial and research applications while establishing foundational technology for a new generation of screenless displays.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
