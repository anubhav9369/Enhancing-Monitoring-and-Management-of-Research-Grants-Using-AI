 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from the creation of one of the first industrial applications of quantum computing. This technology will initially be used to address challenges in the aerospace industry. It may play a crucial role in national defense by aiding in the design of aircraft, missiles, armored vehicles, and naval systems. Over time, the technology will be applicable in other sectors, including automotive, chemicals, energy, and healthcare. This innovative technology will help companies reduce costs and time in developing superior products, such as safer aircraft that consume less fuel, energy plants that emit less carbon dioxide (CO2), and devices that deliver drugs more effectively. The project involves a partnership between academic and industrial researchers. Ultimately, this project will support U.S. leadership in quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop a new computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology that leverages quantum computers. Engineers use CFD to predict fluid flow and to design or troubleshoot various systems, including airplanes, automobiles, and chemical reactors. However, some CFD simulations are currently impossible to perform on classical computers, even though information from these simulations could save substantial costs \u2013 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in certifying aircraft, for example. A quantum CFD algorithm that overcomes the limitations of classical CFD was implemented in a software prototype during the Phase I project, and its performance has been evaluated. Phase II aims to significantly enhance the software performance and demonstrate its effectiveness through a CFD simulation focused on aircraft noise reduction. This project will establish a new generation of CFD technology based on quantum computing, enabling the solution of CFD problems that are currently unsolvable.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
