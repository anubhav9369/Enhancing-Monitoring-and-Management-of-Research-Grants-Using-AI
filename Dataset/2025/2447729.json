 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute supports the training of students.  The program immerses students in cutting-edge research in networking, cybersecurity, AI, and data science. Each student is partnered with a research mentor to help guide their research on a given topic. This REU project will help mentor and grow the next generation of researchers and scientists.\r\n\r\nThe specific research directions that students will explore evolve with each year's mentors and their current research projects.  Projects span a range of topics in networking, cybersecurity, AI, and data science: In networking, research topics include new methods to evaluate networking in interconnected regions of the world, new methods to measure wireless network reliability, and understanding DNS root traffic. In cybersecurity, research topics include innovative ways to detect attack preparation, improvements to privacy by data aggregation, and new approaches to build knowledge graphs for security analysis of cyberinfrastructure. In data science and AI, research topics include AI-driven simulations of human decision making, boosting simulation techniques of quantum, many-body physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
