 "awd_abstract_narration": "Informal STEM Learning (ISL) organizations play a vital role in fostering public engagement with science. They have high rates of visitation and are considered among the public as trusted places for education experiences and leisure time activities. ISL organizations are uniquely positioned to support all learners, including intellectually, developmentally disabled (IDD) and neurodivergent individuals, in that they offer choice, multiple ways of engaging, the opportunity for self-directed and self-paced learning, and learners can engage without the pressures of testing or formal assessment. However, despite their potential to support STEM pathways for all learners, ISL settings have not yet reached their full potential in supporting IDD and neurodivergent individuals. This project is twofold building on prior work with neurodivergent individuals. First it examines the degree to which practices and resources developed previously for zoos and aquariums can be implemented in new contexts (e.g., science museums, children's museums, botanic gardens) that are open to all including neurodivergent individuals. Second, it investigates how those strategies and materials, in settings that are open to all, can support IDD individuals. It also explores ISL employment opportunities that are open to all including neurodivergent and IDD individuals. This award is a collaborative partnership between the STEM Research Center at Oregon State University, Zoos and Aquariums for a Neurodiverse Ecosystem (ZANE), the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), the Association of Children's Museums (ACM) and the American Public Garden Association (APGA), \r\n\r\nThe project will apply the Facilitating Adoption of Best Practices implementation model to guide the studies and project activities to understand the implementation context, identify barriers and facilitators, and document the implementation process and resulting outcomes. Each aspect of the implementation model will be explored through sub-studies including 1) a state of the field landscape study, 2) a community study, 3) transference panels, and 4) comparative case studies. Each sub-study will apply multiple quantitative and qualitative data collection methods including surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, written reflections and review of artifacts. Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics to describe, compare, and determine causal relationships between independent and dependent variables. Qualitative data from state of the field study, community study and transference panels will be coded and analyzed to identify emergent themes. Data collected as part of the case studies will be analyzed using thematic and cross-case analysis for comparisons across study sites. Resources developed as part of the project will be created through design charettes with ISL practitioners and led by professional organizations representing different ISL sectors. The project will result in new understandings of education, hiring and employment practices in ISL organizations. Project outputs include: 1) expanded toolkit of practices; 2) a repository of supports and resources for greater uptake and use of the toolkit among ISL practitioners and organizations; 3) a community of professionals across the ISL field through professional associations (i.e., AZA, ASTC, ACM, APGA) to engage in capacity building; and 4) research findings.\r\n\r\nThis AISL Integrating Research & Practice award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing everyone with multiple pathways for accessing and engaging in STEM learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
