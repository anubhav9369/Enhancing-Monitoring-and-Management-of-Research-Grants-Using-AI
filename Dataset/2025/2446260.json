 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research studies the ways that different communities participate in government-led land management initiatives. Using a comparative research design between two groups, the investigators specifically test for the social, historical, and spatial variables that impact how different communities approach land management and in turn how this affects their participation in and collaboration with broader land management initiatives. In addition to providing scientific training for a graduate student in anthropology, broader impacts of the project involve collaborative creation of an archive to document land management efforts. This collaborative design contributes to enhancing the impacts of community engagement and knowledge co-production in STEM. Research findings will also provide scientifically tested insights into how communities can be integrated into broader land management initiatives by national governments. \r\n\r\nTo understand the variability of participation in land management efforts, the investigators utilize a comparative research design that traces differences between multiple sub-groups. They use historical/archival and qualitative research methods that include semi-structured interviews and behavioral and participant observation. The research expands the science of land management. It contributes to the knowledge base in anthropology and cultural and human geography and provides science-based insights into collaborative land management efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
