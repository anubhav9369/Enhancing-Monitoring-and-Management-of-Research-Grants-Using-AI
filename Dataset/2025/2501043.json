 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to advance the national interest by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) concepts into manufacturing and agriculture coursework to enhance technician education and workforce readiness. As the use of generative AI grows across all sectors, including in manufacturing and agriculture, there is an increasing demand for skilled workers who understand how to apply these technologies. In manufacturing, AI supports predictive maintenance and reduces machinery downtime, while in agriculture, it aids in analysis of environmental data to improve crop and livestock management. To help meet this workforce need, the project intends to develop project-based learning (PBL) activities that provide students with hands-on experience in applying AI in mechanical design, mechatronics, and animal science. Additionally, the project intends to offer professional development for high school educators on integrating AI into their curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: (1) prepare technicians for careers in manufacturing and agriculture using AI technologies and concepts, and (2) build the capacity of rural secondary educators to integrate AI into their curriculum. Topics planned to be covered include using AI algorithms for part optimization, applying AI in industrial data analysis, and working with AI-driven livestock monitoring systems. Project outcomes are intended to be disseminated widely through Creative Commons licensing and could inform similar efforts at other institutions. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
