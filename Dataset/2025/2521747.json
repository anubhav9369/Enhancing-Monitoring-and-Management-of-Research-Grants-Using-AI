 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research studies the impacts of coastal and marine resource shifts on local fishing communities. The investigators focus on tracking the multi-directional relationships that emerge in ocean and marine spaces when new resource management policies and laws are implemented.  They also measure the changes and adaptations of communities to these changes in resource and marine management in these regions over time. Research findings contribute to generalizable social scientific theory on resource management and coastal compliance norms and policies. Broader impacts of the research inform collaborative exchanges and scientific sharing between stakeholders. Training of a postdoctoral trainee, and both graduate and undergraduate student participation in data collection, analysis and publications support the development of early career scientists in cross-disciplinary social and coastal science. \r\n\r\nThe research contributes to our understanding of human interactions with the biological environment and expands on our NSF commitments to investment in scientific discovery in the area of biotechnology. Research results produce generalizable results for our understanding of resource management in coastal regions across the globe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
