 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living people carry archaic genetic material inherited from other hominins such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. This genetic inheritance can affect fitness and health, and its persistence and effects cannot be fully understood unless studies consider each group\u2019s unique population history and the evolutionary processes that shaped them. The goal of this study is to assess the presence and evaluate the impact of archaic hominin ancestry in groups with a complex population history. To achieve this goal, the study applies sophisticated computational genetic techniques to existing information. The study develops educational tools, provides training opportunities for students at different educational levels, and builds capacity in a new generation of scientists.   \r\n\r\nThis research advances knowledge of archaic ancestry in groups with complex admixture. To separate the archaic ancestry contributions from those derived from modern groups, this study analyzes the genomes of individuals that predate well documented historic processes as well as those from modern peoples. To improve admixture models, the study creates computational tools that benefit from artificial intelligence techniques. The study examines the relationship between archaic gene variants and phenotypic traits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
