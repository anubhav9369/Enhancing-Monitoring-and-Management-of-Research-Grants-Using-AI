 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing the number of two-year college students who continue in science and enter the STEM workforce.  By providing paid research opportunities, mentoring, and on-going transfer support, the project expands both access to and awareness of STEM careers. Two-year college students are connected with established professionals, engage in meaningful collaborations with faculty, and participate in research activities that introduce university-level resources. These experiences strengthen academic and professional networks while supporting students through transfer to four-year universities. Ultimately, the project creates a clearer, more supported pathway for students to advance from two-year colleges into four-year STEM programs and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: 1) engage students in undergraduate research, 2) build skills and confidence in STEM, and 3) reinforce successful transitions to four-year institutions. These goals are addressed through a research preparation boot camp in collaboration with a nearby university and a mentoring model that connects two-year college students with postdoctoral scholars. Paid research experiences serve as a foundation for building technical and academic capacity, and structured transfer support extends beyond the point of transfer. Assessment efforts examine the influence of research participation, mentorship, and sustained guidance on student persistence in STEM. A mixed-methods evaluation strategy captures both quantitative and qualitative outcomes and documents the implementation of core project components. Dissemination strategies include conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. Through this comprehensive model, the project offers a framework for strengthening the STEM transfer pathway and preparing students for long-term success in scientific fields. The NSF IUSE: Innovation at Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) Programs seeks to accelerate and advance knowledge about the impact of emerging and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education to two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
