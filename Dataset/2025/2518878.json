 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving curricula for strengthening students' data analysis skills in solid Earth geoscience courses. The ability to process, analyze, and visualize data is increasingly vital for conducting independent research and preparing students for the STEM workforce. The project plans to advance geoscience education by developing upper-level teaching modules that will help students use advanced data analysis to explore the mechanical behavior of the solid Earth. This collaborative IUSE Level 1 Engaged Student Learning track project will also lead and facilitate faculty professional development to enhance data-centric teaching approaches for solid Earth courses.\r\n\r\nTo support the development and application of data analysis and strengthen the quantitative reasoning and self-efficacy of geoscience students, the goals of the project are to: 1) create undergraduate teaching materials for investigating solid Earth geoscience problems with a focus on data analysis skills; 2) lead and facilitate professional development for increasing faculty confidence in using data-rich teaching activities in solid Earth courses; and 3) evaluate the impact of data-rich teaching modules on changes in students' confidence in data-analysis skills in solid Earth courses. The teaching modules will provide freely available instructional faculty resources to teach data analysis in solid Earth contexts to help students develop critical thinking and other skills necessary to succeed in STEM disciplines. During the project, approximately 30-40 instructors and over 400 students will benefit from these efforts. The Science Education Resource Center (SERC) will provide research support, assessment, project evaluation, and website hosting. The National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) will support dissemination. The project plans to contribute knowledge of how professional development activities may increase instructors\u2019 confidence in including more data analysis in their courses. The project also aims to enhance the quantitative reasoning and data analysis skills of geoscience students, preparing them for graduate research, careers in the geoscience workforce, and engaging with challenges such as natural hazards and energy resources. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
