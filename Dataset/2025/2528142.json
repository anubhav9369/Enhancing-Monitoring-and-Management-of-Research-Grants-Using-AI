 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase II project lies in developing an innovative artificial reef tile system designed to replicate the natural growth of oysters, serving as a surrogate reef to jumpstart reef formation. With 85% of U.S. coastal oyster habitats degraded or lost and native oyster populations severely depleted, large-scale reef restoration has become both an ecological and commercial necessity. Rising sea levels, increasingly frequent storms, and escalating damage to coastal communities highlight the urgency of restoring these critical natural barriers. This project leverages the reef-building capabilities of oysters, replicating their natural architecture and shell chemistry, to engineer mass-production molds capable of producing thousands of modular reef units daily. It also offers a smaller-scale manual press option, empowering coastal communities to create their own restoration tiles and actively participate in habitat recovery. By enabling both large-scale and community-led efforts, this technology has the potential to transform global reef restoration practices while linking marine and terrestrial ecosystems under a shared goal. Additionally, it strengthens U.S. leadership in the artificial reef market and sets new standards for restoration effectiveness, as demonstrated by ongoing Chesapeake Bay projects monitored by state and federal authorities measuring environmental and economic impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing a novel 3-D printed metal mold to mass-produce modular dry-cast concrete reef substrates known as Reef Tiles. Designed for large-scale production, this system will enable coastal concrete block manufacturers to create thousands of low-cost reef units daily, close to project sites, reducing transportation costs. The transition from 3-D printed plastic prototype molds to durable metal molds, their integration into block-making equipment, and subsequent field testing form the project\u2019s primary objectives. When assembled, these Reef Tiles form \u201creef mattresses\u201d that can be installed using conventional equipment across a range of marine environments\u2014from shorelines and intertidal zones to deep offshore waters\u2014creating habitats for species ranging from oysters and mussels to cold-water corals, sponges, and associated marine life. Such habitats restore biodiversity, strengthen ecosystems, and support fisheries. Critical technical risks, though reduced during Phase I, remain in the challenges of achieving complex mold topography, ensuring mold strength, and maintaining consistent substrate quality. Additional hurdles include validating the Reef Tile\u2019s effectiveness as a functional reef habitat, verifying long-term structural integrity, and ensuring adequate surface complexity and texture upon release from the mold. Successfully addressing these challenges positions this technology to revolutionize reef restoration while driving scalable, cost-effective ecological impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
