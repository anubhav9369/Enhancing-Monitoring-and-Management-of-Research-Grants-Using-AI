 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on Radio Frequencies (CORF) has been a standing committee of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) since 1961. It is comprised of a changing roster of prominent scientists and engineers who carry out studies and provide advice to the Academy on issues that involve the scientific uses of the radio spectrum. CORF has a long history of working with NSF. CORF also engages in significant outreach and education efforts, providing a crucial avenue for informing policymakers about special needs involved in scientific uses of the radio spectrum. CORF furthers these efforts through outreach to the private sector, encouraging win/win solutions to spectrum challenges. This award will allow CORF to continue this important work.\r\n\r\nCORF plays a crucial role in maintaining the availability of spectrum for the scientific community. Their activities include overview of international treaty conference topics and their impacts on passive service use of the spectrum, the production of educational materials, and submission of comments to FCC proceedings. CORF has conducted, and will continue to conduct, extensive technical analyses that carry significant weight in these proceedings thanks to the process they employ, the quality of work, and the prestige of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
