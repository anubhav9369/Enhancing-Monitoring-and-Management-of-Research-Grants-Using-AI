 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experiential Semiconductor Training in Emerging Nano-Technologies (ExSTENT) project will deliver a nine-week, cohort-based summer program designed by academic and industry partners to provide community college students with foundational hands-on training in semiconductor manufacturing and immersive exposure to four emerging nanotechnology sectors: biotechnology, solar energy, photonic circuits, and quantum circuits. By combining a five-week core course in semiconductor fabrication\u2014covering cleanroom operations, electronic materials, lithography, deposition, etching, and key equipment use\u2014with four, one-week intensive modules co-designed with industry partners, the project will support experiential learning opportunities in nanotechnology for students from all professional and educational backgrounds to address critical workforce gaps in the U.S. emerging technology fields. Participants will gain real-world experience through laboratory activities in UCSD\u2019s Nano3 cleanroom and site visits to local industry facilities, while weekly professional development workshops and individualized mentoring will foster career readiness. Participation in the program will help to create a robust nanotechnology workforce pipeline that advances national prosperity and competitiveness in alignment with NSF\u2019s mission.\r\n\r\nThe project will (1) design and deliver targeted, hands-on training modules that develop competencies in semiconductor engineering and adjacent fields; (2) implement a scaffolded curriculum integrating lectures, laboratory exercises, and industry site visits; (3) evaluate outcomes via pre and post-program assessments, employer feedback, enrollment and retention metrics, and summative annual reports; and (4) ensure sustainability by transferring the core curriculum to community college partners through annual workshops and piloting, and by releasing an open-source toolkit of activity guides, instructional videos, and assessment tools. An advisory board of industry and academic experts will guide curriculum refinement and program evaluation, ensuring long-term scalability beyond NSF support. \r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
