 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a method, based on cryptographic protocols, that can be used in emerging radio spectrum markets so Federal agencies can acquire spectrum quickly when needed without disclosing information that may compromise their missions. Radio spectrum is a vital resource for wireless communication and sensing. Market approaches such as the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model and the Spectrum Bux currency have been proposed to more efficiently use the congested radio spectrum. Since Federal agencies are a significant fraction of the spectrum ecosystem, Federal agency use of these emerging market mechanisms is necessary for the market mechanisms to provide the desired overall benefits for the nation. However, Federal agency missions sometimes require accessing spectrum without delay; most market designs require pre-registration and other slow steps. Agency missions sometimes require protecting information about sensitive operations; most market designs disclose the identity of the buyer to the seller so the seller can enforce payment terms. The cryptographic methods developed in this project overcome these constraints and thereby help emerging radio spectrum markets succeed.  The architecture supports policy adaptation and microeconomic experiments to inform future spectrum policy and market design decisions. The project also helps educate the next-generation spectrum workforce.\r\n\r\nThe core of the project is development of novel protocols based on cryptographic credentials and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technologies. The research effort has three primary thrusts. Thrust one creates a ZKP-capable spectrum credential system to enable efficient attribute-based authentication for spectrum access. This allows users with valid spectrum credentials to request access without prior registration or disclosure of sensitive identifiers. Thrust two develops a secure and auditable Spectrum Bux payment system in the PAYG model. The payment system enables asynchronous settlement that guarantees the band manager receives payment after a user successfully obtains a spectrum access assignment, without disclosing private details about the user. Thrust three develops a simulator for studying the interactions between markets using the new credential and payment systems, user and agency pricing strategies, service-level agreements and other contract types, and Federal spectrum policy choices such as rules for protecting spectrum incumbents. The simulator is used for microeconomic experiments under diverse scenarios, ultimately identifying optimal policy and pricing strategies for specific spectrum-sharing contexts. The outcomes of this research will be made publicly available online, including publications, tutorials, and open-source software.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
