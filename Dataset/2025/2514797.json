 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the study of nuclear reactions that drive astrophysical processes. In particular, the PIs focus on the study of extreme astrophysical environments where the participating nuclei are short-lived and not naturally found on earth. The PIs will perform experiments at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and other complementary facilities, which can produce these exotic nuclei. Through these experiments the PIs will investigate the synthesis of heavy elements in stars and will explore the inner workings of stellar explosions. The training, mentoring, and career development of the next generation of nuclear scientists is an important element of the project, which supports graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. In addition, the PIs actively share their research and educate the public through talks, videos, popular-science articles and local events. \r\n\r\nRare-isotope science plays a critical role in the new era of astronomy where the complete sky is surveyed continuously to reveal the dynamic nature of the cosmos. Understanding the nuclear processes driving the observed astrophysical events such as stellar explosions or colliding stars is essential to interpret observations from some of the most extreme environments encountered in the cosmos. The project will continue the established experimental nuclear astrophysics program at FRIB to provide important nuclear physics input for two broad topics: 1) The origin of the heavy elements, and 2) The engines of stellar explosions. The experiments will address nuclear reactions and nuclear structure properties that were identified in sensitivity studies as important ingredients into computer models of dynamic astrophysical events to explain observations. The measurements will provide input to heavy-element nucleosynthesis via such processes as the rapid and intermediate neutron capture processes, the neutrino process and the neutrino proton process. In addition, the PIs will address explosive fusion reactions in supernovae, and we will provide data on electron capture processes inside neutron stars. \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the goals of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\" meta-program by conducting experiments that will aid in the interpretation of stellar explosions and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
