 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to expand the U.S. workforce in artificial intelligence (AI) by developing a career pathway model that integrates nontraditional education with industry-based learning experiences. Focused on participants from regions where access to emerging technology careers may be limited, the project prepares individuals to transition into AI occupations through a structured sequence of learning, mentoring, and internship opportunities. In collaboration with a university-based research center, a global IT consulting firm, and regional economic development organizations, the project supports participants in gaining skills aligned with real-world occupations in AI. These efforts are expected to contribute to economic growth, support workforce readiness, and increase national capacity in AI. The project aligns with the NSF mission by promoting the progress of science and strengthening the U.S. economy through investments in future-ready talent.\r\n\r\nThe project will design and evaluate a university-industry-community collaboration model to prepare 24 participants, recruited over two annual cohorts, for transitions into careers in AI. Selection is based on professional potential and alignment with the project\u2019s training goals. The project includes individualized advising, mentorship, community building activities, experiential learning, and the creation of an Individualized Development Plan (IDP) to support participant engagement and progress. Participants will complete foundational training focused on technical competencies required for specific AI job roles identified by the industry partner. Each participant will engage in a 10-week internship and may be eligible for a one-year apprenticeship. Project outcomes will be assessed through performance evaluations, capstone project presentations, and follow-up surveys conducted at three post-project checkpoints. This project will contribute to the knowledge base on workforce development in emerging technologies and offer a replicable model for building career pathways into AI through nontraditional learning pathways. \r\n\r\nThe ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
