 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Matthew Panthani and Aaron Rossini from Iowa State University are studying the origin of light emission in a two-dimensional (2D) form of silicon (Si) nanomaterials, Si nanosheets. The Si nanosheets will be labelled with different types of atoms in the surface to better understand the surface chemistry of 2D silicon, developing understanding of how surface chemistry is linked to its light emitting properties. This research will have potential applications in next-generation computing and telecommunications technologies that are faster and more energy-efficient. The research will be coupled to activities that encourage engagement between academia and industry in the region, as well as contribute to the development of high school teachers and future STEM workforce participants.\r\n \r\nWith the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Matthew Panthani and Aaron Rossini from Iowa State University are studying structure-property relationships in two-dimensional Si derived from the layered Zintl phase, calcium disilicide. The research will use isotopic labeling to reveal structure-property relationships in 2D nanosheets.  The research will include three objectives: (1) synthesizing 2D Si with precisely defined surfaces, incorporating isotopic labels, (2) characterization of the surfaces, and (3) determining relationships between the structure and optical properties. Using combination of characterization tools - including vibrational spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and computational modeling - will enable the researchers to develop an unprecedented understanding of the surface chemistry of 2D silicon, and insight into the origin of its light emission.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
