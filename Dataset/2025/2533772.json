 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the convening of a series of workshops and collaborations with the Evolutionary Anthropology Society. The PIs organize a series of multidisciplinary workshops that bring together both senior and early career scientists from across the range of Evolutionary Behavioral Science (EBS) disciplines. The workshops will address how EBS approaches can be integrated and translated to other disciplines to expand the science of human behavioral and cultural variation. Broader impacts include the development and mentoring of a scientific workforce. The multidisciplinary perspectives that can be leveraged from EBS encourage new perspectives toward the development of scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe project responds to federal priorities for scientific workforce development in areas of integrated science and the scientific understanding of the impacts of biological factors on human behavior and adaptation. The PIs also develop a robust program in collaboration with the Evolutionary Anthropology Society to help build a pipeline to address critical workforce gaps through systematic skills development in integrated social science. Outcomes include the development and adoption of biotechnological innovations and workforce development in areas critical to the development of the bioeconomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
