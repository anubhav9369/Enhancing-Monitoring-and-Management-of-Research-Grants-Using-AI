 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on developing and expanding Workplace Navigation (WN) skills training for two-year college students in technical programs. This initiative equips students with essential skills to 1) identify workplace opportunities that align with their personal needs, goals, and priorities, 2) assess their work environment critically, and 3) overcome challenges that could hinder their success, such as by clarifying expectations and seeking constructive feedback. This initiative builds on insights from two-year college graduates who have identified WN skills as key to their career growth. By creating accessible, scalable training and resources for students and programs nationwide, this project supports students to confidently navigate technical workplaces, positioning them for success and contributing to a stronger, more adaptable national workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to accelerate the integration of WN skills training across two-year college technical programs and explore the scalability of these modules beyond the biotechnology sector. In collaboration with the California Bioscience Workforce Development Hub and InnovATEBIO, a national center for biotechnology education, the project seeks to establish a national Workplace Navigation Hub to 1) provide WN modules for students, 2) support faculty nationwide in embedding these modules into their curricula, 3) examine the broader applicability of WN modules in technical fields beyond biotech, and 4) offer guidance to work-based learning programs on incorporating WN practice strategies. The scope includes not only developing training materials but also studying their effectiveness in improving student learning and success in technical careers, ultimately shaping a workforce equipped to meet the demands of advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.  To maximize impact, the project plans to disseminate outcomes and materials widely through the Workplace Navigation Hub, InnovATEBIO, and social media channels, including LinkedIn biotech education groups. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
