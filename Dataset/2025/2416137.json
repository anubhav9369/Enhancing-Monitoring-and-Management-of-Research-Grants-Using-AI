 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable the development of advanced cyberinfrastructure to digitize and integrate over one million dragonfly and damselfly (Odonata) specimens from major natural history collections across the United States. The project, called Di-ODE (Digital Integration of Odonata), will create a unified, publicly accessible digital platform through Odonata Central, linking high-resolution specimen images with critical data such as collection localities and species identifications. This initiative will expand access to these important biological resources for scientists, educators, students, and the public. Di-ODE includes robust training programs to build skills in biodiversity data science and collections digitization. The project will enhance STEM education, promote data literacy, and engage community scientists, contributing to environmental awareness and scientific literacy. Through outreach and digital accessibility, Di-ODE will strengthen efforts to monitor environmental change and inform freshwater conservation across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe project will transform how Odonata biodiversity data are accessed and analyzed by the research community. Dragonflies and damselflies are ecologically sensitive indicators of freshwater health and have been the focus of major studies in evolutionary biology, systematics, and biogeography. However, much of the valuable specimen data remains locked in poorly accessible physical collections. Di-ODE addresses this gap by creating efficient, scalable digitization workflows, using customized optical character recognition (OCR), advanced georeferencing, and data management tools. The resulting infrastructure will enable novel research in global change biology, comparative ecology, and phylogenetics. By improving data quality and access, Di-ODE will foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and provide a model for digitizing and mobilizing data from other invertebrate groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
