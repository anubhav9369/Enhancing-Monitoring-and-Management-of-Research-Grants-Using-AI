 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores how topological features\u2014captured through computable invariants and classification schemes\u2014help organize complex mathematical structures known as operator algebras.  Operator algebras originally served as a robust mathematical framework developed by von Neumann and others to model Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics, and their study is a vital part of modern analysis. Enduring interest in this area of research centers largely on its many connections and applications to other mathematical and scientific fields. Operator algebras can be constructed from, and in some cases encode, many important mathematical structures such as symmetries, time-evolving systems, graphs, and number fields. They also play a significant role in areas like quantum computing and condensed-matter physics. A primary focus of this project is on discerning the fine structure of infinite-dimensional operator algebras through approximations by simpler, finite-dimensional models. The project involves mentoring of early-career researchers and students through guided investigations and collaborative learning experiences.\r\n \r\nThe research focuses on one of the most important recent results in operator algebras, namely the classification of simple amenable C*-algebras of finite non-commutative covering dimension. Connes' Fields medal-winning work on the structure and classification of amenable von Neumann algebras in the 1970s remains fundamental to modern von Neumann algebra theory, and in the topological setting of C*-algebras, the Elliott classification program was initiated in the 1990s seeking analogous results for simple amenable C*-algebras. This large-scale, worldwide endeavor recently culminated in the complete classification of separable, simple, nuclear, Z-stable C*-algebras in the UCT class. This project involves far-reaching generalizations of such results, with applications beyond the classification program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
