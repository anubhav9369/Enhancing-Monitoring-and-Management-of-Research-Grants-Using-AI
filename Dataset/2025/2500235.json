 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the growing demand for skilled technicians in New York\u2019s Capital Region, a specialized training initiative emerged to support the workforce needs of its expanding biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. This Track 1 ATE project expands and enhances the initiative by strengthening regional engagement with the bioeconomy and local educational opportunities. Over three years, participants take part in hands-on experiences that introduce key biotechnology concepts, highlight career and educational pathways, and develop practical, real-world skills.  The project fosters interest in biotechnology careers and supports professional growth. Designed for adaptability, its methods serve as a model for other communities nationwide. By directly connecting local communities with biotechnology career and educational pathways, the project opens entry points into the field and significantly increases the number of technicians entering the workforce, ultimately contributing to the expansion of the nation's bioeconomy.\r\n\r\nExpanding a biotechnology program and increasing awareness of biotechnology career pathways serve as the overarching goals of this initiative. Achieving these goals involves (1) evidence-based curriculum development, (2) strategic program planning and recruitment, and (3) effective assessment to guide ongoing implementation. Through a range of initiatives\u2014including adult awareness sessions, family enrichment nights, summer camps, and career advisor lunch-and-learn events\u2014the project engages an estimated 500 community members. These experiences take place in community-based settings such as high schools, libraries, community centers, and the region's Educational Opportunity Centers, ensuring accessibility for local residents.  Curricula for these programs incorporate input from both the community and industry partners to equip participants with a strong understanding of the skills and training needed for entry into the biotechnology workforce. Additionally, program instructors receive training on effective engagement strategies to connect with and inspire community participants. Evaluation of the project examines the effectiveness of these interventions by analyzing participant numbers, outcome surveys, and enrollment growth in biotechnology degree programs.  Curriculum developed through this project reaches educational institutions regionally and nationally through conferences, databases, and the State University of New York system. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
