 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to establish a new paradigm in wireless energy transfer that significantly enhances the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles, increases the profitability of drone-driven industries, while advancing U.S. priorities in energy independence, national security, and technological leadership. This project enables real-time wireless power delivery to drones, eliminating the need for frequent battery swaps and the associated logistical complexity, unlocking fully automated, perpetual drone operation. This advancement paves the way for a new class of high-value drone systems powered by continuous wireless energy, enabling transformative capabilities across sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and surveillance. In defense applications, the system supports uninterrupted reconnaissance in mission-critical environments, helping safeguard protect military assets. As the technology matures, it has the potential to displace inefficient and labor-intensive power infrastructure in disaster-stricken areas, saving lives during emergencies by providing emergency power. In addition to its commercial benefits, the project promotes workforce development and job creation through the scalable commercialization of wireless power systems. This innovation positions the United States at the forefront of the emerging wireless energy transfer industry, with significant societal and economic impact.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to advance the development of a long-range, high-efficiency millimeter-wave wireless power beaming system designed to deliver continuous, real-time power to airborne drones. The primary goal is to transition the technology from laboratory-scale demonstrations to a fully integrated, field-deployable solution suitable for real-world drone operations. To achieve this, the project will pursue three key technical objectives: (1) demonstrate a scaled-up wireless power beaming system capable of high-power transmission over long distances; (2) develop reconfigurable transmitters to enable dynamic beam steering and range focusing; and (3) develop a high-precision tracking technology to precisely locate moving aerial targets. The system will be tested through both hover and in-flight experiments, where drones will receive sustained power while airborne. These developments will result in a robust wireless power delivery platform with practical utility for heavy-duty drone applications. Additionally, the project will contribute to the broader scientific understanding of near-field electromagnetic beamforming, millimeter-wave power transmission, and adaptive wireless energy delivery to mobile platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
