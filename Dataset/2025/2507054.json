 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in enabling safer, more precise, and cost-effective robotic system sensors and actuators for use in space and on Earth. The proposed magnetic gear technology has the potential to significantly enhance in-space manufacturing by increasing the durability, efficiency, and performance of robotic actuators. This improvement is expected to unlock new capabilities for industries such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and food production by allowing advanced research and manufacturing in microgravity. The innovation also supports national defense needs through its applicability for In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) robots and Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking (RPOD). On Earth, the same technology offers value in automation, food packaging, and collaborative robotics by enabling safer, longer-lasting, and more energy-efficient systems. The project promotes U.S. economic competitiveness and high-tech workforce development, while advancing public health and welfare through more efficient production of critical goods. An additional societal benefit is enhancing public scientific literacy through publication dissemination. A fully U.S.-based supply chain strengthens domestic manufacturing capacity, while also enhancing partnerships between academia and industry and supporting a globally competitive American workforce.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the unmet need for more reliable, energy-efficient, and precise motion control systems for robotic applications in space. Current robotic actuators used in orbit are prone to failure, produce excessive vibrations, and are often cost-prohibitive for widespread use in emerging space operations. This project will validate a new magnetic gear actuator that eliminates mechanical backlash and significantly reduces vibration and noise\u2014extending operational lifetime by over 700% and improving energy efficiency by up to 21%. The technology will be sent to low earth orbit and tested in persistent microgravity to demonstrate compliance, survivability through launch, and sustained performance in space. Research objectives include verifying compliance with acoustic standards, confirming torque feedback accuracy within 1% of the full torque range, and demonstrating impedance control stability across most of the actuator\u2019s capabilities. The project outcome, if successful, will be a space-qualified actuator that improves mission availability, reduces maintenance costs, and enables safer and more dexterous manipulation. These advances will address key limitations in space robotics and create pathways for adoption across a range of scientific, commercial, and terrestrial automation sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
