 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of three-dimensional (3D) ceramic printing in a customer-accessible setup. The development of low-power, fast, 3D ceramic printing could meet the increasing demand for customized and complex designs across various sectors, including biomedical, aerospace, automotive, and electronics engineering. Such 3D printing offers enhanced customization, cost-effectiveness in small-batch production, and the capability to utilize advanced materials for high-performance applications. Cost-effective rapid prototyping will enhance the competitiveness of technology and innovation in the United States and the energy efficiency of the new materials will make the products of the printing process more accessible. The new printing system improves both the quality and speed of printing, making 3D ceramic printing available to a larger number of applications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a novel, low-power laser materials melting system. This process is designed to address the operational challenges of three-dimensional (3D) laser ceramic printing while retaining the advantage of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. The 3D ceramic printing involves the sintering or melting of ceramic powders with high melting points. Current selective laser melting printing produces high-quality, ready-to-use parts. However, the high-power laser, along with the management of safety hazards associated with high-temperature operations and powder materials, has made current ceramic printing methods accessible to only specialized 3D printing businesses. The new powder-based materials efficiently convert laser power to heat and rapidly elevate the materials\u2019 temperature to the melting point of ceramics. These feedstocks are available for current commercial printers and would allow these printers to operate at a fraction of the laser power at room temperature, significantly reducing operational costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
