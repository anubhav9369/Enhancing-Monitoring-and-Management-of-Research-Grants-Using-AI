 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project aims to improve how river flow is monitored. River flow is important for managing water supplies and reducing flood risks. Many organizations face challenges in measuring stream flow accurately due to increasing demand on water resources. This project introduces a new monitoring system designed to be safer, more efficient, and more precise than traditional methods. By using advanced instruments and modern communication technology, the solution will enhance understanding of river systems and provide data for decision-making in agriculture and infrastructure protection. The project outcomes have commercial potential, offering benefits to federal and local agencies, businesses, and other organizations involved in water management.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to improve stream flow monitoring by addressing the inaccuracies of current methods. Traditional monitoring systems often struggle to provide reliable data during rapidly changing flow conditions because they rely on simplistic empirical models. This technology takes a different approach, using physical principles and advanced technology to deliver more precise measurements. Unlike conventional methods that focus on a single section of a river, the solution employs a multivariate hybrid system, capturing a broader and more accurate picture of stream flow. This innovation is expected to enhance forecasting accuracy and hazard prediction, making it a valuable tool for improving water management and flood mitigation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
