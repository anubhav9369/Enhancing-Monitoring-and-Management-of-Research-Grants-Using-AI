 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of the conference is to bring together national assets, institutional expertise, and regional momentum to offer unified approaches to yield transformative and wide-ranging impacts in the areas of innovation, economic development, and workforce transformation: The Conference will serve as a catalyst to bring together unmatched intellectual capital, national innovation infrastructure, and community commitment to help shape paradigms for innovation and economic development and workforce development among cross-representations of higher education, industry and government partners. The convening amplifies the role of regional institutions, mobilizes industry-government alignment, and through one-on-one, and roundtable sessions with subject matter experts, offers replicable frameworks for regions seeking to build competitive, resilient, and inclusive economies.   \r\n\r\nTo address the nation\u2019s priorities, the conference will impact several critical issues, including: (1) addressing the gaps that exists in technology skills, and commercialization and aligning innovation efforts with national priorities in science and technology. Huntsville, Alabama, one of the nation's premier innovation hubs, provides an ideal setting for this conference, located within a region which exemplifies a unified approach which will yield transformative and wide-ranging impacts in the areas of innovation, economic development, and workforce transformation; (2) providing information on best practices for regional innovation-led development; hence demonstrating how a region anchored by ecosystems encompassing a city committed to growth, and major federal and industry partners can jointly accelerate innovation pipelines. The rich content will showcase place-based innovation powered by partnerships across institutions. Moreover, the conference will aid in positioning emerging research institutions, small and rural institutions as central actors in research translation, tech transfer, and federal-industry engagement. The conference will focus deeply on workforce development rooted in real industry needs emerging from Industry stakeholders that will provide participants with critical information to directly engage with higher education to align curriculum and credentials with labor market demand. New pathways will be built for students in aerospace, cybersecurity, AI, and advanced manufacturing strengthening University-Industry-Government connectivity. Finally, as a key impact, the Summit will seed long-term partnerships in joint research, workforce pilots, innovation consortia, and regional talent pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
