 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers.  The \"CURE-IT\" project aligns directly with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science and advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by transforming undergraduate STEM education at Rust College through the integration of authentic research experiences into the curriculum. The national imperative to develop a highly skilled STEM workforce is critical to maintaining the United States\u2019 leadership in science and technology, fostering innovation, and addressing complex challenges. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes to address educational challenges by embedding Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into Rust College\u2019s core science courses, providing equitable access to hands-on research and fostering a culture that values inquiry and innovation. Over three years, the project will develop research modules and an implementation strategy, that progressively increases student independence, culminating in presentations and dissemination of research findings. The approach enhances student engagement and retention and prepares more equipped graduates with the skills needed for innovation-driven economic growth, improved public health, and national security. By supporting faculty development and creating sustainable curricular models, the project ensures long-term impact that extends beyond Rust College, serving as a scalable example for similar institutions nationwide. The anticipated increases in STEM retention, research capacity, and workforce readiness directly contribute to national priorities of sustaining scientific leadership, fostering economic prosperity, and ensuring an innovative scientific community capable of addressing tomorrow\u2019s challenges\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
