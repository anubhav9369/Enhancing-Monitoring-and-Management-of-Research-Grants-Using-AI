 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address the workforce needs of the semiconductor industry by increasing awareness of semiconductor manufacturing and related career opportunities among community college student populations. The project intends to include high-impact practices such as mentorship activities involving engineers and technicians, as well as evidence-based, NSF validated practices that utilize introductory micro-/nanotechnology workshops for students and faculty. Development of new project activities that augment existing micro-/nanotechnology programs are intended to create pathways for semiconductor-based employment. Upon successful completion of the proposed program, students are expected to gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing and a network of professionals to consult regarding career opportunities, increased awareness of the importance of micro-/nanotechnology, and access to a program that provides micro-/nanotechnology-based training. Students who complete this program will be poised to help meet the needs of the semiconductor workforce by working as technicians at local industry sites or articulating to a four-year transfer institution for advanced education and training.\r\n\r\nThe two primary goals are (1) principal investigators will leverage existing relationships with industry professionals serving on the microscopy professional advisory committee to evaluate and augment the existing micro-/nanotechnology certificate program. This will be accomplished with increased industry involvement which includes annual on-site industry visits exposing students to day-to-day operations at semiconductor fabrication sites. (2) Project activities will be used to increase enrollment in the existing micro-/nanotechnology certificate of proficiency program. A series of new introductory characterization and fabrication workshops will introduce students to commonly used micro-/nanofabrication techniques. These techniques will include atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and photolithography. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program and is supported in part by funds from Intel Corporation under the ETSTE DCL. The program focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
