 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of an optical microscopy technology that enables real-time, label-free imaging of biological samples with high accuracy. Traditional imaging systems that measure cell morphology and dynamic behavior are often prohibitively expensive, limiting access to advanced imaging tools. This solution addresses the need across biological research and medical diagnostics for cost-effective, noninvasive imaging systems. By integrating the technology with conventional microscopes, the solution reduces both acquisition and operational costs, expanding usage to smaller laboratories, clinics, and educational settings. This technology has potential applications in disease diagnosis and cellular biology, offering a more affordable approach to visualize and analyze nanoscale structures. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a compact, low-cost optical attachment that transforms existing microscopes into dynamic quantitative phase imaging systems capable of real-time, label-free, four-dimensional imaging. The system leverages inexpensive liquid crystal materials and custom-designed optics to achieve nanoscale precision in measuring cellular morphology. Unlike conventional systems that require costly optical components and sample staining, this approach preserves sample integrity while delivering high spatial and temporal resolution. Adoption of this innovation may improve health outcomes, accelerate biomedical research, and promote greater access to scientific tools, serving the national interest in improving healthcare, research, and educational infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
