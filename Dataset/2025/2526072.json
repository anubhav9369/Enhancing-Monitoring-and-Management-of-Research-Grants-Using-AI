 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ExLENT Beginnings Track project aims to serve the national interest by developing robust experiential learning pathways in Semiconductor Quantum Technologies (SQT) that expand workforce opportunities across the state of New York. Encompassing advanced semiconductor manufacturing, quantum information science, microelectronics, and photonics, the SQT sector underpins many next-generation technologies, yet the United States faces an urgent workforce shortage in this critically important area.  This challenge has been intensified by an aging workforce, increasingly complex production demands, and a surging global need driven by rapid advances in AI and Quantum computing. Importantly, New York state is home to an expanding semiconductor ecosystem, positioning it to lead workforce development efforts that may serve as a model for other parts of the country. This initiative brings together a cross-sector partnership that includes New York City College of Technology and Queensborough Community College, the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC), and two industry partners. Through immersive, hands-on experiences, associate and bachelor's level STEM students engage in the full technology development cycle. By supporting entry into careers across the SQT landscape, this effort responds to urgent workforce needs while advancing national competitiveness. \r\n \r\nThe project pursues five key objectives: 1) provide students with hands-on experiences in traditional semiconductor manufacturing and quantum computing applications through practical training and internships, 2) introduce students to advanced semiconductor research by utilizing ASRC's Photonics Core facilities, 3) leverage industrial expertise to ensure curriculum alignment with current manufacturing needs, 4) incorporate innovative perspective to prepare students for emerging technologies, and 5) establish clear pathways into careers in the advanced semiconductor manufacturing and quantum computing sectors. To implement these objectives, the initiative integrates a sequence of structured experiences, including a winter seminar on semiconductor fundamentals, spring professional development and virtual industry sessions, summer site visits, and intensive research boot camps and internships. Distinct tracks for associate- and bachelor-level students engage more than 45 participants over three years. City Tech's newly developed quantum technology curriculum combined with industry exposure and mentorship, equips students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Evaluation and assessment efforts employ a mixed-methods approach with a focus on project implementation fidelity and the impact of program activities on participant outcomes. Dissemination occurs through local and national channels, including the CUNY Teaching and Learning Conference, publications and professional presentations. Overall, this effort advances the development of a collaborative, replicable model to advance both technology development and workforce preparation. The NSF ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and their access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
