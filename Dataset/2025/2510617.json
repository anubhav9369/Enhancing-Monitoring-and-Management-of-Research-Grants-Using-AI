 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project contributes to HBCU-UP program goals by transforming the way chemistry is taught and learned. Through the creation and study of immersive virtual reality learning environments, the research team provides an opportunity for students to better visualize and understand complex chemistry concepts. Specific project goals include the development and implementation of updated curriculum materials, virtual reality labs, and professional development workshops for chemistry instruction. The project addresses a national need to improve student engagement and achievement in science, especially among students in the rural south. Outreach activities allow the project to engage high school and community college students in science education innovations to increase awareness of and interest in chemistry. By developing interactive tools and faculty training grounded in educational and psychological principles, the project supports the advancement of science, fosters innovation in teaching, and contributes to workforce development in fields critical to regional and national prosperity and well-being.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on developing fourteen virtual reality chemistry lab modules that simulate core laboratory concepts, such as molecular structures, electron configurations, and chemical reactions. These modules are being a) implemented in general chemistry courses that serve over six hundred students annually at Alcorn State University and b) integrated into workshops on technology-enhanced teaching practices. The research team is partnering with specialists in education and psychology to ensure that learning tools are designed using evidence-based practices in pedagogy and cognitive science. The project includes faculty training in instructional design and innovative teaching strategies to support effective adoption. Virtual reality lab modules are shared with other institutions under an open educational license to promote broad dissemination. The project is advancing science education through immersive technologies and generating open-access teaching resources and professional development tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
