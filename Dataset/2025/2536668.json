 "awd_abstract_narration": "Airborne particles released by wildfires, ranging from fine smoke to larger ash and firebrands, are increasingly recognized as a significant yet understudied factor affecting freshwater ecosystems. These particles span a broad range of sizes (from micrometers to centimeters) and exhibit diverse chemical compositions, including both nutrients and harmful substances. As they are transported through the atmosphere and deposited across landscapes, they can have a variety of ecological impacts on aquatic ecosystems, including altering thermal and physical dynamics, contributing excess nutrients, and introducing toxic metals. Despite their potential significance, the chemical composition, spatial patterns, and ecological consequences of particles released by wildfires are still not well understood. Additionally, existing national monitoring programs tend to concentrate on smaller particle sizes (e.g., smoke), often overlooking the larger, and possibly more ecologically impactful, particles. This FIRE-NET initiative aims to bridge this gap by bringing together scientists from various disciplines to study how wildfire particles move through the atmosphere and impact freshwater ecosystems. This effort will enhance public knowledge and support informed environmental decision-making to protect water resources in a world increasingly shaped by fire. It will also support the training of early-career scientists, the development of accessible tools and protocols, and public engagement through open data sharing and outreach events.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of virtual and in-person meetings, this FIRE-NET network will bring together experts in atmospheric science, aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, fire modeling, and soil science. The group will collaboratively 1) Discuss and recommend methods for better quantifying how wildfire airborne particles spread across the atmosphere and deposit on the landscape; 2) Assess the chemical composition of wildfire airborne particles as they are transported from the source of ignition and deposited in the landscape; 3) Create a more detailed conceptual framework to refine our understanding on how wildfire airborne particles influence lake ecosystems; and 4) Propose protocols to improve the monitoring of wildfire airborne particles during active fires so we can quantify their potential influences and identify the mechanisms leading to changes in lakes. These activities will combine empirical field data, fire and atmospheric modeling, machine learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration to understand particle dynamics and ecological outcomes. Focusing on fire-affected sites in the western U.S. and leveraging existing data networks, the project will develop tools and frameworks that enable more accurate prediction and management of wildfire impacts on aquatic ecosystems, thereby helping to build environmental resilience in the face of increasing wildfire frequency and severity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
