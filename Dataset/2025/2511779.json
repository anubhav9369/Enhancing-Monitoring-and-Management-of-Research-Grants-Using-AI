 "awd_abstract_narration": "This instrument development project will construct a next-generation molecular imaging instrument to visualize biological tissues and engineered materials that mimic biological systems. By integrating advanced laser optics, custom ion source design, gas-phase separation strategies, and high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis, this instrument will provide revolutionary capabilities for visualizing biological molecules. The new instrument will help expand the understanding of cellular systems. The project will be conducted in close partnership with leading investigators who are working to solve emerging challenges in biotechnology and human health. These collaborations are intentionally selected to drive iterative co-development and maximize real-world impact. The resulting platform will broaden the availability of high-performance imaging capabilities to researchers in academia, federal laboratories, and private industry. The instrument will be housed within the Vanderbilt University Mass Spectrometry Research Center, a nationally recognized hub for molecular imaging and mass spectrometry, and it will serve to train new generations or researchers. This project will strengthen national infrastructure, expand access to advanced technologies, and provide advanced capabilities for molecular discovery and biological research.\r\n\r\nThe instrument to be developed is a state-of-the-art matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry platform that integrates trapped ion mobility spectrometry with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance for high-specificity molecular imaging at cellular spatial resolution. Leveraging the high-field 15 Tesla magnet from a decommissioned instrument, the project will combine ion mobility gas-phase ion separation with a custom Omnitrap collision cell for multi-mode fragmentation and the ultra-high mass resolving power of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. This unique platform will enable deep analysis of isobaric and isomeric chemical species, high spatial resolution molecular imaging (<5 micron pixel sizes), ultra-high mass resolving power (>1,000,000), and comprehensive structural characterization of a wide range of biomolecules. Housed at the Vanderbilt Mass Spectrometry Research Center, the platform will serve as a cornerstone for interdisciplinary research across biology, engineering, and medicine, and will support extensive training activities through established workshops and collaborative activities. The system represents a major advance in molecular imaging capabilities, providing the scientific community with a powerful tool for answering complex biological questions, accelerating discovery, and advancing the frontiers of spatial omics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
