 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site trains college students in data science methods and tools. The objectives of the program are to: 1) equip students with expertise in data science methods and tools, 2) increase interest in data science, and 3) increase the number of students pursuing graduate studies in a data science or quantitative social science fields. Students work with university researchers on a multidisciplinary set of research projects of societal importance. They will get hands-on experience with computer tools and data from sources like maps, surveys, and public records. They will also learn various data science methods including causal modeling, simulation, geocoding of addresses, map visualizations, machine learning, and web scraping.  This REU site also includes workshops to help students build confidence, learn about careers, and share their research findings. This program is committed to cultivating the next generation of data scientists through rigorous training and applied research.\r\n\r\nThe program begins with a two-week Data Science Boot Camp, where students learn computer programming, statistics, mapping, and responsible research practices. After this training, students join research teams to investigate important questions using large datasets. All students will contribute to applied research with societal impact. Students will be prepared to engage with generative AI and large language models, apply AI methods to societal challenges, and confront emerging frontiers in biomedical data science. This program prepares the next generation of data scientists by providing the analytical and computational training necessary to address complex, emerging societal challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
