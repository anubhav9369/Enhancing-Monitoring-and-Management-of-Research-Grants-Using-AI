 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Rural Appalachia Research in biosensing Technology (RAREST) is hosted by West Virginia University. The project features research investigations in health disparities in rural Appalachian areas, such as tick-borne infections, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Nine REU students per year will engage in research opportunities with significant local and national impact, focusing on biosensor-related projects in health. Undergraduates will work in small groups state-of-the-art sensor research labs, guided by interdisciplinary faculty across engineering and chemistry. Students will engage in hands-on research, weekly presentations, workshops, entrepreneurship training, and a research symposium, promoting collaboration and innovation in biosensing technology. The REU Site will directly address the educational and economic challenges faced by rural Appalachian students, and result in equipping them with the skills and guidance needed to pursue high-skill, tech-focused careers.\r\n\r\nEnabling rural sensor and automation technology will require new approaches in several interdisciplinary research areas. These projects feature topics including developments in miniaturization and microfabrication technologies (such as neuroprosthetics), the use of novel bio-recognition molecules, and low-energy strategies for deploying as point-of-care tools (e.g., wearable sensors). Students from socio-economically disadvantaged regions will be recruited to engage in this program and grow into more independent-thinking researchers.  Professional development activities will focus on pursuing graduate education, entrepreneurship training to enable new start-ups in rural settings, and regional outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
