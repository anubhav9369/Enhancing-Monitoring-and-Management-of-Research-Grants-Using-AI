 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. life sciences industry is rapidly expanding, creating a strong and growing demand for skilled workers. In San Diego, home to major life science employers, the biotech and medical device sector plays a vital role in the regional economy, generating $1.5 billion in venture investments. To support continued industry growth, this project aims to help meet the region's need for more than 300 job-ready technicians each year by providing specialized hands-on training, mentorship, and career exploration opportunities. Recognizing the importance of expanding access to biotech careers the project provides high school students with comprehensive laboratory training and a direct route to college. By expanding the pool of skilled, job candidates, this initiative supports the biotech industry's drive for scientific discovery and innovation in medicines, therapeutics, and medical devices.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to establish a structured pathway with multiple entry and exit points, guiding students from high school to a Certificate of Achievement in Biotechnology at San Diego Miramar College and into skilled technician careers. To achieve this goal, the project focuses on three key activities: (1) introducing high school students to biotechnology careers through a Biotech Awareness Curriculum Package, in-class college curriculum with loaner kits, family night events, and a hands-on summer enrichment experience; (2) recruiting students through hands-on non-credit and credit experiential learning, credit-by-exam opportunities, and dual enrollment; and (3) retaining students through a college credit summer bridge program, certificate or degree completion, and work-based learning opportunities. Students gain access to internships, mentorship, lab skill development, and career exploration. Industry and K-12 partners further strengthen the initiative through career panels, industry tours, and high school engagement. Best practices and models developed through this project are designed for adaptability by other two-year colleges. The project team seeks to share outcomes, practices, and partnerships through InnovATEBIO, California Biotech Communities of Practice, and the Workforce Development Council. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on preparing technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
