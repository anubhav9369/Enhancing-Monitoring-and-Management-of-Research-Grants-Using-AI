 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will support travel and participation costs for U.S. university students and early career scientists to attend the upcoming US-Africa conference on nanotechnology and engineered human environments. The conference will take place in Nairobi, Kenya from April 13-17th, 2026. The conference is organized in partnership with the Africa Materials Research Society (A-MRS). The core objective is to advance knowledge and enhance understanding in nanotechnology and engineering, to promote collaboration and progress in the fields, and foster integration of cognitively broad perspectives in these areas. This US-Africa conference will play a crucial role in unifying perspectives among global practitioners. The goal is to create a platform for leading U.S. scientists to interact and initiate lasting collaborations with emergent international engineers. \r\n\r\nThe US-Africa conference on nanotechnology and engineered human environments will take place in Nairobi, Kenya from April 13-17th, 2026.  This conference will play a crucial role of injecting new perspectives into the U.S. engineering research community and will also enable deeper understanding of how engineering  affects and/or relates to the social and physical environment. The conference thematic talks will bridge ideologies by bringing together international engineers and scientists to discuss a common topic, enabling emergent convergence of otherwise isolated ideologies that advance fundamental engineering and science.  As a result of this event, participants will be able to transcend basic and applied research, fostering knowledge sharing, collaboration, and exchange activities with leading experts presenting new findings and setting future directions. Highlighting a commitment to education and building research capacity, the conference provides a unique platform for international students to interact with each other and leaders. This year's conference will encompass a wide range of topics including nanotechnology, nanotechnology in energy, frugal science, and the intersection of nanotechnology, human interaction and the environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
