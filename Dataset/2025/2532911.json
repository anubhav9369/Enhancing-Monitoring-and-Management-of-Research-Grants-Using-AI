 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract: This project explores a new concept called Intrinsic Superconducting Spin-Electronics, which has the potential to transform high-performance computing and quantum device technologies. The research focuses on a class of superconducting materials that host a quantum state in which paired electrons align with parallel spins, in contrast to the antiparallel configuration of conventional superconductors. This intrinsic spin alignment enables compatibility with magnetic materials used in spin-electronics research. Through this activity, the research team investigates devices such as Josephson junctions and superconducting diodes to advance understanding of novel superconducting phenomena and support the development of next-generation logic, memory, and quantum devices. The education component emphasizes advanced training and exposure to state-of-the-art research for students at Texas State University. The research team includes both graduate and undergraduate students who are representative of the student body at Texas State University. Outreach activities include superconductivity-themed demonstrations during visits to local high schools, participation in campus-based visit days, involvement in internal events such as the Physics Conference and Careers Fair, and engagement with student-led organizations.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The research investigates noncentrosymmetric superconductors with intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. The initial goal is to deposit candidate materials, such as niobium-rhenium alloy, and characterize their superconducting properties. These materials are fabricated into devices, including ferromagnetic Josephson junctions and narrow-track diode structures, to test two key hypotheses: that intrinsic spin-triplet junctions can sustain higher critical current densities than conventional proximity-based systems, and that noncentrosymmetric materials can enable a true intrinsic supercurrent diode effect. In conventional superconductors, such as niobium, efforts to achieve practical superconducting spintronic devices have been limited by low critical currents through ferromagnetic barriers and by ambiguity in identifying genuine diode behavior. By employing noncentrosymmetric superconductors with intrinsic spin-triplet pairing, the research team aims to overcome these limitations. The results will advance fundamental understanding of unconventional superconductors and support progress in the emerging field of Intrinsic Superconducting Spin-Electronics and quantum information technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
