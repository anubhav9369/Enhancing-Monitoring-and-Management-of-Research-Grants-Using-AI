 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is studying how to use metals like iron and copper that are readily available from the Earth\u2019s crust for the laboratory preparation of chemical building blocks. This collaborative program will help define how we can productively control the environment around the metal in a way that maximizes the efficiency of the reactions being studied. The transformations that are targeted are valuable because they focus on reactions of feedstock aromatic chemicals that are often derived from petroleum refining or, with growing frequency, from sustainable sources. The expected reaction products will plug into a variety of useful applications, from materials science to chemical biology, that rely on functionalized organic compounds. Consistent and ongoing outreach efforts will enhance the impact of the project through connections with the broader community. This project is being conducted in collaboration with Prof. Benjamin Darses of the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes in France and who is receiving separate financial support through the French National Research Agency (ANR).\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is studying dearomatization reactions catalyzed by transition metal complexes derived from Earth-abundant metals such as copper, iron, and nickel. The collaborative project will advance our understanding of how the characteristics of metal-ligand complexes interface with different reagent combinations to promote challenging arene cyclopropanation reactions. The research will provide tools for the intramolecular and intermolecular dearomatization of heterocyclic and carbocyclic arenes, providing the chemical community with new chiral building blocks derived from feedstock aromatic starting materials. We will develop processes to compete with the current state of the art provided by rhodium complexes to address problems associated with the latter\u2019s cost, scarcity, and environmental impact. By continuing and expanding existing relationships and outreach with the community, the impact of the project will be enhanced.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
