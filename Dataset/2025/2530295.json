 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important events in the history of life in the Americas was when North and South America became connected by a land bridge\u2014the Isthmus of Panama\u2014which occurred between 15 million years ago and the present day. This connection allowed plants and animals to move between the two continents. Scientists have studied land plants to better understand when this event happened, but we still do not know how rivers played a role in how the land bridge formed. This project will study a special group of plants that live in tropical and subtropical rivers rapids and waterfalls, called riverweeds. Using information from both plant fossils and the DNA of living plants, we will study how these plants moved and evolved as the land bridge. Combining information about plants with geologic data, we hope to understand when rivers began to connect, and how these changes affected the plants living in them. This project will help science grow by training American scientists to work together with scientists in other countries and in various languages. The project will also help train new partners, strengthening the pathways for future American scientific research.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a novel lens on biotic migration during the rise of the Isthmus of Panama by leveraging the tight link between Podostemaceae plants and river evolution, adding a new element to the story of the Isthmus closure, and shifting the focus from terrestrial to unexplored freshwater systems. The traditional approach in plant evolution research is to interpret biological data using geological models. In this project, however, genomic data will be used to infer the timing and pattern of riverine plant migration across the Isthmus, which will then be coupled with geological and fossil data to build a wholistic model of river connectivity across the Isthmus of Panama. The project will use a recently developed method for the integration of distributional and genomic data to refine the resulting models of past landscape change. This interdisciplinary approach will not only clarify the tempo and mode of riverine connectivity across the Isthmus but will also fill critical gaps in our understanding of tropical biodiversity assembly in freshwater ecosystems. The project also includes opportunities for training for students ranging from high school to postdoctoral scholars.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Systematics & Biodiversity Science and Life through Environment and Time programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
