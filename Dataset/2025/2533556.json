 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\nDigital lensless holographic microscopy (DLHM) is a compact and cost-effective imaging technique that eliminates the need for traditional lenses. DLHM enables the observation of transparent, unstained microscopic organisms in their natural environments. Improving the DLHM technology will significantly enhance our imaging infrastructure and ability to observe organisms across a broad range of applications, ranging from human healthcare to ecosystem monitoring. In particular, DLHM technology has the potential to deepen our understanding of marine ecosystem structures, dynamics, and functions. The integration of DLHM systems into mobile platforms will enable direct observation of aquatic microorganisms that play key roles in ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. In addition to its scientific impact, this project will promote workforce development and public engagement in science and engineering. Educational activities will include workshops and outreach programs that will introduce students to optics and environmental sensing.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nCurrent DLHM systems are limited by trade-offs between spatial resolution and field of view, as well as by high computational demands for image reconstruction. The proposed DLHM system addresses the unmet need for lensless imaging by designing, investigating, and evaluating an advanced DLHM system, which features a large imaging volume by multiplexing multiple illumination sources, improved resolution, reduced noise, and rapid localization and classification of microscopic samples by exploiting modern AI imaging processing models. As an application, we will evaluate the capability of the proposed DLHM system to monitor biodiversity on water columns in real time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
