 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year REU Site: Chemical Engineering and the Future REU students will participate in a 10-week summer program providing research opportunities in metallurgical and materials engineering that enhance the global competitiveness of the nation in the areas of mineral beneficiation, resource recovery, critical metals, advanced materials, manufacturing, and energy-efficient materials. Students will participate in an integrated professional development program that nurtures their research skills and career development. This program includes advanced technical communications training; workshops and seminars to give historical context for current trends in research; research methods and instrumentation training; and collegial activities that connect students to each other and the community. This context will give students a broader appreciation for the nature of current and future research as well as the impact of engineering in society.   \r\n\r\nThe project will address challenges faced by future engineers by providing research experiences within a unique cultural and holistic framework. Participants will also engage in research projects of historical and cultural significance with the National Park Service, Sioux Indian Museum, and National Music Museum focused on the preservation and analysis of historical artifacts. Special sessions will be led by subject experts from engineering, science, and the humanities that explore the interface between engineering, history, and art. Professional development activities feature the importance of metals throughout history (metal forging and casting). This Site will provide opportunities and recruit students early in their engineering careers.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
