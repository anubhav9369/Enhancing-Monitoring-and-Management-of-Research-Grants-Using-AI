 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a multifunctional, uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) to monitor water quality and detect harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs in freshwater bodies pose significant threats to both public health and the environment. These blooms, often fueled by excess nutrients such as phosphorus, can produce toxins that affect water quality. The neurotoxins released by certain bacteria species can contaminate water supplies, posing serious risks to human health. The rapid growth of these blooms can disrupt local ecosystems, harm biodiversity, and impact agriculture, tourism, and recreation. Timely monitoring of HABs and water conditions is critical for taking prompt action to protect public health and water safety and security. Current in-situ and remote sensing methods are limited by factors such as high labor intensity and cost, inefficiency, and an inability to provide real-time monitoring. This sensing system facilitates the identification of nutrient sources and conditions that promote algal bloom formation, helping to inform targeted strategies for mitigating or preventing future outbreaks. Furthermore, by tracking HABs and measuring water condition parameters, this technology allows researchers and policymakers to evaluate the effects of these events on aquatic ecosystems, including potential changes in species composition and ecosystem services. This solution has the potential to enhance sensing efficiency, reduce cost, expand coverage, and deliver more comprehensive monitoring results. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of an uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) that combines the benefits of both in-situ and remote sensing, enabling real-time monitoring of harmful algal bloom (HAB) distribution, movement, and water conditions. The technology is equipped with multiple onboard sensing devices including multispectral imaging cameras, and can measure temperature, total dissolved solids, turbidity, potential of hydrogen, and other factors in real-time, using wireless data transmission. Additionally, this solution features a novel multi-tube water sampling structure, allowing for the collection of water samples from multiple locations to enable advanced laboratory analysis to identify cyanobacteria and characterizing HABs. The multispectral imaging camera enhances the system\u2019s ability to visually monitor water conditions across a wide region, facilitating the tracking of HAB distribution and movement. Furthermore, the system incorporates a geographical information system to record spatial and temporal water condition data, generating maps for comprehensive water and HABs monitoring and management. This UAS-based water sensing system offers better monitoring of water conditions with increased versatility, efficiency, and precision in data collection and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
