 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will aims to equip Arizona's student population with the knowledge and skills needed to enter and thrive in the rapidly growing semiconductor industry. In partnership with Arizona State University, University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, and the Chandler Unified School District, this project intends to build clear, flexible educational pathways from high school through community college to university and industry employment. It plans to emphasize outreach, multimodal learning opportunities, and strong engagement with local employers. The project intends to help students from Arizona to access high-paying technical careers, support the state's economic development and help close regional workforce gaps in advanced manufacturing and microelectronics.\r\n\r\nThis project intends to develop industry-aligned curricula to establish robust training partnerships, promote flexible learning models, and foster professional learning communities among educators and industry partners. The project plans to create new courses and credentials for semiconductor technician roles, implement articulated credit pathways, and integrate with apprenticeship programs and state-level career initiatives. Through the formation of an Integrated Semiconductor Industry Advisory Board and rigorous program evaluation, the project intends to continuously refine its offerings in response to evolving workforce needs. The anticipated outcomes include increased student retention, improved job placement in the semiconductor field, and a scalable model for national replication. This initiative intends to make a significant contribution to technician education, regional workforce development, and the national goal of strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program and is supported in part by funds from Intel Corporation under the ETSTE DCL. The program focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
