 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a wearable, noninvasive, sweat lactate sensor that tracks fatigue-related biomarkers in real time. Designed for comfort, the sensor sends live data to a smartphone or computer using custom wireless electronics. Lactate is a key substance the body produces during intense exercise, and it is often used to measure how hard someone is working. Testing for lactate usually requires drawing blood, which can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. The new sensor allows the user to measure lactate through sweat instead of blood, enabling users can get real-time updates on their physical performance. With continuous tracking, people can make smarter decisions about when to rest, which can help prevent injuries caused by fatigue. These types of injuries cost the U.S. billions of dollars every year. Overall, this technology supports better health, safety, and performance.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a fabric-based, wearable, sweat lactate sensor, created through the electropolymerization of lactate oxidase and carbon nanotubes onto a nonwoven fabric substrate. The sensor interfaces with wireless electronics and a user-friendly app to provide continuous feedback on lactate levels during physical exertion. Positioned at the intersection of human performance monitoring and wearable technology, this solution targets commercial adoption within public service sectors, particularly firefighting and military training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
