 "awd_abstract_narration": "Television is a highly effective way of communicating about science and nature to the widest possible audience, both in the U.S. and globally. BBC Natural History and Factual Productions Ltd. and BBC Studios Americas Inc. are updating the iconic television series trilogy of Blue Planet, Planet Earth, and Frozen Planet. The U.S. Antarctic Program will provide logistical support and access to field sites in Antarctica for the filming of sequences to be used in a third release for the Blue Planet series. While building on the hallmarks of the original series - spectacular cinematography, compelling storytelling, scientific accuracy, and never-before-seen animal behavior - this sequel is intent on advancing knowledge and understanding of the natural world by showcasing how variable environments impact wildlife throughout the global ocean. A final episode will be devoted entirely to the future of the ocean. The expected release date for the film is in late 2026. Field-based scientists from the National Science Foundation's Antarctic program are scientific advisors to this project.\r\n\r\nThis award is for logistic support only for filming marine life and landscapes with NSF-supported research programs at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The Blue Planet III television series will be supported by additional media output, frequently specially shot, to enable science and educational content to reach audiences beyond the TV series. These additional products include a digital short-form content showcasing scientists, conservationists, and film crews at work in the field, multi-media 360\u00b0 video content, and virtual reality output. The Planet series had unprecedented reach when it first aired \u2013 Planet Earth reached 65 million people in the U.S. and Frozen Planet\u2019s premiere was watched by 10% of the country. Great numbers have been drawn to their sequels \u2013 Blue Planet II\u2019s U.S. premiere was the most-watched nature program on U.S. ad-supported TV in nearly a decade. An innovative distribution pipeline for ancillary output has widened the reach of this influential content, with increased opportunity to profile the critical work of institutions, scientists, and film crews in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
