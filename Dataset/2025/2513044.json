 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance fundamental understanding of atomic and nuclear physics, areas crucial for deciphering the universe's most basic principles. The research team will make highly precise measurements on atoms, addressing two key areas. First, they will investigate the nuclear structure of oxygen isotopes using precision spectroscopy. These measurements provide essential data for understanding how atomic nuclei are built and behave. Second, the team will perform spectroscopy on light atoms like beryllium, boron, nitrogen, and oxygen. The goal is to provide experimental data that, when combined with theoretical predictions, will serve as stringent tests of the community\u2019s best theory describing how light and matter interact. Beyond scientific discovery, this award supports the training of highly motivated undergraduate students at Smith College, fostering their development into future scientists. The project will also expand a course-based research initiative, making experimental atomic and nuclear physics accessible to a greater range of students across the country.\r\n\r\nThis research program focuses on high-precision spectroscopy of neutral light atoms with four, five, seven, and eight electrons, pursuing two primary objectives. First, the team will investigate the nuclear structure of stable oxygen isotopes through precision spectroscopy to establish crucial baseline measurements. This work will directly support upcoming experiments on radioactive oxygen isotopes at the BECOLA facility at Michigan State University, providing critical data to benchmark microscopic nuclear theory, lattice calculations, and many-body methods, and to constrain low-energy constants in chiral effective field theory. Second, the project will continue established work testing Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) through precision measurements of absolute transition frequencies and absolute energies in beryllium, nitrogen, and oxygen. For beryllium, the team aims to achieve sub-MHz precision with a redesigned experimental system.  This research program will be expanded to include boron.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
