 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from Long Beach City College (LBCC) will increase the number of automotive technicians that possess the skills to work on hydrogen fueled vehicles, with a particular focus on building a sustainable program that will provide opportunities for all participants. The project will collaborate with employers and industry members to create courses and a certificate that will allow new students to obtain a broader knowledge of alternative fuel vehicles while simultaneously encouraging existing technicians to upskill and increase their employability. In the revised courses students will participate in work-based learning activities that will connect them with local employers, expose them to the industry, and prepare them for the automotive workforce. The creation of these courses will fill a critical gap in automotive training for California, which is a national leader in the implementation of hydrogen fuels and the first state to receive Federal funds for a hydrogen energy hub to augment the country's existing energy portfolio. Despite being at the forefront of implementing hydrogen fuels, there is currently no dedicated certificate or degree for hydrogen automotive technology in the state. Over the three years of the project an initial cohort of 25 students will begin classes, with the number of class offerings and participants expanded in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of the project are to 1) address the lack of hydrogen automotive certificate in the region; 2) increase the number of automotive technicians with the skills to work on hydrogen fueled vehicles; and 3) expand opportunities in this program to include all students at LBCC.  The project will align academic offerings with industry needs through a well-represented advisory council that includes employers and industry members.  Participants will benefit from a curriculum that will quickly train them for employment in the field and will be able to complete the stand-alone certificate in under nine months. Faculty associated with the program will benefit from professional development with updated equipment and teaching methods that will allow them to lead the new hydrogen-related courses. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
