 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Marquette University. Over its six-year duration, this Track 2 project will fund scholarships to 35 unique full-time students who are pursuing graduate degrees in computer and information science/data science. Post-baccalaureate students will be given the opportunity to forge a career pathway into a professional Master of Science (MS) in computer and information science/data science program and will receive scholarships, on average, in five academic terms (out of a total of six terms). Specific project activities include (i) development, delivery, and assessment of impactful distance learning adaptations to the Foundations of Computing bridge course as well as co-curricular supports for students seeking a career change; (ii) investigation of factors influencing the development of computing professional identity in post-baccalaureate career-changing individuals; (iii) dissemination of findings re-curricular and co-curricular activities that promote successful conversion into computing for students who have little prior academic training in computing. A unique feature of Marquette University's Master of Science in computer and information science program is the provision of a model for students to cross over from non-STEM undergraduate degrees to high demand, well-paid jobs in computing. An important broader impact of the project is the diversification of the pool of qualified computing professionals through inclusion of academically talented low-income students. The intellectual merit of the project is the generation of new knowledge on optimal bridge course content and delivery as well as program academic supports for students who have little prior academic training in computing.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to significantly increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Specifically, the project will update an online computer science bridge course to expedite a post-baccalaureate career pathway into a professional Master of Science in Computer and Information Science program. The underlying rationale for the project is the need for a mechanism for students with non-computing and non-STEM undergraduate degrees to acquire competencies in computing that can lead to a Master of Science degree in computer and information science. There is evidence of growing demand for this type of bridge course among a broad adult population, furthermore, the career change opportunity will have a positive effect on the local and regional workforce through provision of training needed to fulfill current education and workforce development needs. The project will advance development of the bridge coursework that provides accelerated coverage of background concepts for the specific needs of career changing individuals. Knowledge generation is expected regarding the development of computing professional identity in post-baccalaureate, career-changing individuals. For formative and summative evaluation of the impact of the bridge course, quantitative data will be collected by the evaluation team through surveys, while qualitative data will be collected through one-on-one or group interviews. Dissemination of findings will occur through journal articles, conference papers and posters at computer science education conferences, regional professional organizations as well as community stakeholders, businesses and organizations actively involved with student practicums. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
