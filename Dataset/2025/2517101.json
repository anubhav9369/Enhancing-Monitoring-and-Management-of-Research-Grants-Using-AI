 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research investigates the societal impacts of forensic science, particularly of genetic and DNA analysis. As genetic identification and DNA analysis are becoming widely used at the community level, the data collected from this study expands the translational impact of forensic science. The data collection uses a longitudinal research design to track changes over time in how communities engage forensic science and DNA analysis. Using ethnographic and behavioral data collection with families, forensic scientists and community members, and the analyzing of archival sources, the investigators track ongoing forensic investigations. Broader impacts inform educational and citizen science initiatives through wide dissemination of data and findings and will improve public literacy on the relationships between forensic science, technology, and society.\r\n\r\nThe research makes contributions to the science of forensic science and community responses to genetic analysis and DNA testing. The research will expand the participation and training in science and the scientific workforce by supporting the training of a graduate student in anthropological science. The research also provides insights into the science of forensic science. By expanding our understanding of the societal impacts of DNA testing and the new tools and technologies of forensic science, the project responds to NSF priorities in translational science. The project also advances NSF priorities in biotechnology by furthering understanding of the human adoption of biotechnological innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
