 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel means for providing in hospital image-guided navigation to improve the accuracy and affordability of surgical procedures. Surgical procedures, notably those involving the spine, require high levels of precision. Existing navigation tools implent more complex, higher cost disposable components, or invasive technologies that prevent greater widespread adoption especially in smaller hospitals and outpatient centers. This project aims to commercialize a novel technology that enables surgeons to project images of patient\u2019s internal anatomy and various tool positioning directly onto to the patient\u2019s body surface for direct visualization in real time with sufficient precision for specific operational procedures. By improving surgical accuracy and reducing complications such as misplaced implants or reoperations the objective is to improve patient outcomes with a modern navigation tool while reducing operational and hospital costs.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on developing the technical components needed for a new surgical navigation method that combines 3D sensing and light projection in an interactive and responsive manner. The technology development includes furthering software development that enables the system to analyze the position of the patient and anatomy in real-time and accurately align medical images with the patient\u2019s body. The project will also include designing a novel manner of displaying surgical information on the skin surface in a clear and helpful manner for the surgeon within accuracy, latency and human factors requirements for clinical use. Bench validation testing will be performed to measure how accurately the system matches images to the patient, with the goal of meeting or exceeding industry accuracy standards. The end objective of this project is an operating validated prototype tested in a controlled laboratory setting, suitable for more advanced testing and commercial and clinical pilot studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
