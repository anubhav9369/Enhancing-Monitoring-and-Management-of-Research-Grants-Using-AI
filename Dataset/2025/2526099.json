Brookings Metro, in collaboration with Heartland Forward and the Builder Platform, will use the Engines program as a \"learning laboratory\" to codify lessons, strategies, and replicable models that enhance innovation policy and practice. \r\n\r\nThrough publications, case studies, events, and strategic communication, the project will examine how Engines drive technological innovation, national competitiveness and security, foster shared prosperity, and integrate talent, economic development, and governance systems within different regions. The initiative aims to provide actionable insights to regional and national stakeholders, as well as to the community of practice within regional innovation ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
