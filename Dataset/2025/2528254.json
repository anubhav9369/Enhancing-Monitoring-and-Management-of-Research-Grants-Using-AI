 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is centered on developing and scaling up a technology platform for 100% bio-based and 100% biodegradable materials designed to replace high carbon footprint materials like leather and synthetic leather. The technology platform uses a bio-based polymer structure and cross-linking polymer-filler that is compatible with both inorganic mineral and organic fibrous fillers, imparting superior material properties to the end-product. Over two billion square yards of leather are produced per year in an $86 billion annual market. The leather industry is associated with environmental concerns such as unwanted emissions into the atmosphere, animal agriculture, deforestation, and water pollution caused by toxic chemicals used to process, tan, and dye leather. Synthetic alternatives to leather are currently made of petroleum-derived plastics that are not biodegradable, instead breaking down into microplastics that persist in the environment and pose potential health risks to humans. With growing demand for eco-friendly products and reduction in carbon footprint, the materials produced by the proposed technology will meet need for eco-friendly materials in industries including fashion, footwear, apparel, and automotive.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis project will build on the company\u2019s novel polymer structure and unique polymer-filler cross-linking system, scaling up the technology while preserving its high performance in tensile strength, elongation at break, coating adhesion, flex resistance, abrasion resistance, and hydrolysis resistance. Initial R&D efforts will focus on optimizing the polymer\u2019s structure, viscosity\u2013temperature profile, and degrees of unsaturation and cross-linking to meet the safety and handling requirements of a pilot-scale polymerization reactor. The goal is to ensure compatibility with existing mixing, coating, and cross-linking processes, minimizing the need for new infrastructure, while also evaluating environmental impacts and carbon footprint. By doing so, the project aims to deliver a high-efficiency, cost-effective, eco-friendly, and commercially viable production method for this next-generation class of 100% bio-based high-performance materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
