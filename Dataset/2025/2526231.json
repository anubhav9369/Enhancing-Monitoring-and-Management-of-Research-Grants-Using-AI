 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds a structured, experiential learning model that prepares students, veterans, and career-transitioning professionals for roles in emerging technology sectors such as biotechnology, artificial intelligence, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing. The initiative provides paid internships at early-stage companies and commercialization training designed to meet the evolving needs of the innovative economy. Through national outreach, flexible scheduling, and modular program delivery, the program supports individuals entering high-growth fields. The initiative serves the national interest by strengthening the U.S. startup ecosystem, expanding the skilled workforce, and enabling broader access to innovative-related careers.\r\n\r\nParticipants begin with a structured commercialization curriculum focused on venture\r\ndevelopment, intellectual property, and startup readiness. Following this training, they complete\r\ninternships with STEM focused Kentucky-based startups, where they apply their skills to market analysis, customer discovery, and product development. The program leverages a cohort model, startup mentorship, and industry collaboration to provide hands-on experience in research translation and business innovation. Through continuous evaluation and collaboration with academic and industry partners, the project builds a replicable model for preparing emerging technology talent. Expected outcomes include improved commercialization capacity for startups, high-quality workforce development metrics, and a sustainable training framework that can be adopted nationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
