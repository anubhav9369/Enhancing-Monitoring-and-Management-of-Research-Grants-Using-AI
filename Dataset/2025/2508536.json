 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pathogens originating from wildlife pose an increasing threat to agriculture and public health. Yet, predicting when and how these pathogens spill over into domestic animals or humans remains a significant challenge. This is mainly due to limited knowledge about which reservoir hosts interact with potential recipient species, how long those interactions last, and which types of contact are most likely to result in pathogen transmission. Recent advancements in animal biologging and pathogen genetic sequencing are opening new opportunities to map contact networks and trace pathogen transmission across species. This research integrates animal tracking data, pathogen genomics, and mathematical modeling to better understand and predict cross-species transmission dynamics. The project focuses on blood-feeding vampire bats, key wildlife reservoirs for rabies virus, and the livestock upon which they feed. By analyzing interactions between these species, the project aims to identify patterns of contact and transmission that can inform more effective surveillance and control strategies. Given rising concerns over emerging zoonotic pathogens, the research is timely. It not only advances methods to integrate diverse data streams to study spillover but also provides practical insights into managing vampire-bat livestock conflict, an issue of growing concern. The research will also broaden participation by mentoring trainees, strengthening scientific capacity in our study areas, and engaging communities through school programs and public outreach on infectious disease prevention.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to (1) characterize dynamic, multi-species contact networks between vampire bats and livestock using animal-borne proximity sensors; (2) map pathogen-sharing networks by analyzing genetic similarity among common viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens (e.g., coronaviruses and rabies virus, hemoplasmas, and trypanosomes); and (3) develop statistical and simulation models to identify likely transmission routes, understand epidemiological dynamics, and inform rabies virus control strategies. The outcomes will advance our fundamental understanding of pathogen spread in complex host communities. Additionally, our integrative approach, combining animal tracking with pathogen diagnostics, will offer a valuable framework for studying cross-species transmission in other systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
