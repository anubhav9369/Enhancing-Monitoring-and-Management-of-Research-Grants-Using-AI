 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Division of Chemistry Research Instrumentation program, and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Strategic Initiatives. In this project, the University of North Dakota (UND) will acquire a gas chromatograph coupled with a high-resolution mass spectrometer (GC-HRMS), integrated with thermal desorption and pyrolysis modules to support the research of Professor Alena Kubatova and colleagues, Professors Yun Ji, Melissa Schmitt, and Mahmut Ersan. This state-of-the-art instrument greatly expands and modernizes GC-MS capabilities in the upper Midwest region, enhancing the region\u2019s capacity for high-resolution detection of complex samples for sustainable materials, biological and forensic studies, and emerging contaminant monitoring. The GC-HRMS will facilitate the research of 19 faculty members, including 7 early-career faculty, and will directly engage at least 18 undergraduate students and more than 25 graduate students. This instrument will be integral to both teaching and research, providing quality training for undergraduate and graduate students in chemical characterization. In addition, its use and demonstrations in outreach and educational programs will provide tools for recruitment in science and STEM workforce development in the region.\r\n\r\nResearch enabled by this instrument is focused on four key areas: 1) Plastic decontamination and recycling with a focus on the fate of emerging contaminants, e.g., per-fluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS); 2) Atmospheric and environmental chemistry exploring air particulate matter, pollen, and persistent organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and pesticides; 3) Synthesis of alternative chemicals from biomass; 4) Biological and forensic studies addressing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission profiles from various matrices to investigate postmortem intervals, plant chemistry, and wildlife behavior patterns. The specific design of the instrument, including thermal desorption and pyrolysis modules, will enable comprehensive studies to address low and high-molecular-weight species. The targeted samples can be investigated with either evolved gas analysis, enabling real-time monitoring, or via gas chromatographic separation, providing detailed speciation of complex mixtures. The instrument data processing will be supported by UND\u2019s cyberinfrastructure, allowing remote access and facilitating collaborations with geographically distant institutions, including community and tribal colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
