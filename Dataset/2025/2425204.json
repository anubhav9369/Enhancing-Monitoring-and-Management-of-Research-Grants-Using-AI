 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Central Oklahoma to develop a 5-year strategic plan that enhances the infrastructure for the Selman Living Laboratory (SLL) field station. This project will create a strategic plan to modernize the station\u2019s infrastructure, enabling scientists to study critical ecological questions. By creating a strategic plan, SLL will not only expand scientific research opportunities but also enhance educational opportunities for students in PK-12, institutions of higher education, and outreach opportunities for the general public. A modernized SLL will become a center for environmental education, fostering a greater understanding of ecological principles and promoting scientific literacy within local and regional communities.\r\n\r\nThe SLL is located in the Cimarron Gypsum Hills ecoregion in northwest Oklahoma. The field station contains mixed-grass prairie, gypsum caves and outcrops, and wetlands. The fourth largest cave system in Oklahoma is also found at the SLL. Several organizations collaborate with the Selman Living Laboratory including Starcreek Astronomical Club that hosts public stargazing events at the field station. The intent of this project is to engage and inform identified stakeholders and current regional field station directors to collaborate in meeting infrastructure needs that will enhance the expansion and use of the SLL. Using a holistic approach in the development of a 5-year strategic plan will further strengthen public and private networks and enhance collaborations across disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
