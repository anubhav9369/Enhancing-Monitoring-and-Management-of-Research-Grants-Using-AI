 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be an acceleration of discovery in the fields of chemistry, biology, physics, and materials science by enabling atomic resolution electron microscopy at previously inaccessible cryogenic temperatures. The company is entering the $5.6 billion electron microscopy market, with a $1.1 billion market opportunity in the broad market of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) accessories. The niche market for this product in materials science and nanotechnology applications is $250 million in value. For broad accessibility, the cryogenic cooling instrument will be compatible with nearly all major TEM models. At a cost less than 10% of the purchase price of a typical TEM, the product will extend the lifespan and capabilities of available microscopes. Domestic manufacturing of ultra-cold TEM instruments will place the nation at the front of metrology for atomic-scale engineering in semiconductor, quantum, and biomolecular research. Adoption by universities, national labs, and commercial research and development labs will provide workforce training and development in high-demand technological areas including metrology of quantum electronic devices, cryogenic engineering, and advanced instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the realization and commercialization of an ultra-cold cryogenic cooling instrument tailored for atomic imaging below 1 Angstrom within transmission electron microscopes. Cryogenic cooling with liquid helium has long been a challenge in the field of transmission electron microscopy, due to challenges of vibration and temperature stability. This innovation combines continuous liquid helium flow, integrated vibration isolation, and precise tuning of temperature to achieve atomic resolution TEM imaging with unprecedented operation times. The demand for this capability is longstanding: next-generation computing paradigms, renewable energy materials, and quantum sensing take advantage of phenomena that emerge at extremely low temperatures, but TEM imaging currently cannot characterize the underlying materials at the relevant low temperature operating conditions. Through novel cryogenic designs, optimization of temperature stability, and minimization of mechanical vibrations, this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal will enable ultra-cold TEM imaging for the design and synthesis of next-generation materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
