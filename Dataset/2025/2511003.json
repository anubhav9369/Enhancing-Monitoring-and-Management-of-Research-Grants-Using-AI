 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Idaho (UI) to enable the Genomics and Bioinformatics Resources Core (GBRC) to acquire an Element Biosciences AVITI24 sequencing platform, a technology that combines traditional sequencing with advanced single-cell and multi-omics capabilities. This instrumentation will power transformative research with direct societal impact, including efforts to improve agricultural resilience, protect endangered species, and advance biomedical discoveries related to infectious diseases. As the first platform of its kind in Idaho and the inland Pacific Northwest, the AVITI24 will strengthen regional scientific infrastructure, foster new collaborations, and expand access to high-quality genomics tools across institutions. The research will also support training initiatives that equip students and early-career scientists with hands-on experience in cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics, helping build a skilled STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research enabled by this platform at UI will significantly expand the capacity for innovative work across disciplines such as biomedical science, microbial ecology, conservation biology, and evolutionary genetics. The AVITI24\u2019s high-throughput sequencing and single-cell profiling features will allow researchers to investigate gene expression, microbial communities, and cellular interactions at unprecedented resolution. These capabilities will enhance ongoing studies of species adaptation, genetic disease mechanisms, and host-pathogen dynamics while also promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration. By fostering technological advancement and generating new knowledge, this investment will elevate research competitiveness at UI and broaden the region\u2019s contribution to national scientific priorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
