 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Steven Diver of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, is studying new catalysts embedded in cage-like frameworks for selective catalysis. These catalysts are hybrid molecules, combining the best attributes of enzymes with the high performance and wide chemical repertoire of small molecule (molecular) catalysts. This new design will enable selective reactions, which will have impact in a number of different fields such as organic synthesis, polymer chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry related to drug discovery. In addition to these applications, there are broader societal impacts from this research activity. The research activity will prepare students for careers in chemistry and chemistry related fields and advances sustainability concepts in synthesis. The use of these new selective catalysts has the potential to vastly improve efficiency and provide new synthetic possibilities which will streamline the synthesis of bioactive molecules. This may in the long run accelerate the drug discovery process and reduce the cost of medicines for the American public.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Steven Diver of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, is studying new bimacrocyclic catalysts for size-selective reactions catalyzed by the earth abundant metals, Mn, Co, Ni and Co. The key objective is the design and modular synthesis of multidentate ligands, whose macrocyclic size can be easily and predictably adjusted. Within two ligand classes proposed, the macrocyclic design will create or enhance enantioselectivity, allowing molecular recognition in terms of both steric size and chirality. New catalysts that can manage reactivity through site selectivity will allow synthesis to be carried out differently, without protecting group manipulations to select which functional group should react. This will greatly increase efficiency and decrease costs, waste and environmental impact. Size-selectivity based on the bimacrocyclic ligand will allow members of the same functional group to be distinguishable from each other, enabling site selectivity. This new approach to chemical synthesis would change the way a synthesis can be conducted, reduce the need or reliance on protecting groups and would vastly increase efficiency. These new macrocyclic catalysts will be used to achieve selectivity in high value reactions such as alkene epoxidation, cross coupling and alkene hydrofunctionalization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
