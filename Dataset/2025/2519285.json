 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project envisions a prosperous and secure Arctic region focusing on Alaska that can build, maintain, and operate resilient and sustainable coastal and interior civil infrastructure and can adapt to the dynamic marine and terrestrial environmental changes. This vision will be achieved by engaging with Alaskan communities, industry, and local-to-federal government entities, thereby building a pipeline for workforce development of future scientists, engineers, and skilled workers with expertise in Arctic environments. The team will collaborate with the North Slope Borough and the communities in Seward Peninsula to co-develop and implement the solutions to emerging challenges, notably coastal and riverine erosion in the Arctic coastal communities, infrastructure failures induced by permafrost degradation, and flooding. The resilience solutions and technologies, from ideation to implementation, will be co-developed through close collaborations with partners of Indigenous communities, industry, local to federal government, and six academic institutions. The impacts include improved well-being and resilience of individuals and communities in the U.S. Arctic, increased economic competitiveness of the U.S., improved national security, and increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.  \r\n\r\nThe project will generate new understanding of how the Earth system (including the northern and northwestern Alaska region, permafrost, and coast-land interface) changes, and its interactions with the built and sociocultural systems, thus building the foundational knowledge base to develop solutions to emerging problems. At the end of Phase-1, the project will (1) identify and specify the solutions needed to address the U.S. Arctic challenges from permafrost degradation, erosion, and flooding, (2) identify data gaps and devise approaches to collect new data for the technology development, (3) define specific requirements for the technologies and solutions, and (4) identify application sites for the technologies and solutions and collaborating partners. Project costs and feasibility in translation of research to solutions will be demonstrated by conducting techno-economic analysis on enabling technologies and system-level solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
