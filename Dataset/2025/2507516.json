 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to revolutionize security screening through the development of a terahertz (THz) imaging radar system for contactless concealed weapons detection. The technology has significant potential to enhance public safety in high-security areas such as public transit and schools. By enabling non-invasive, real-time threat detection of both metallic and non-metallic objects, this innovation addresses critical needs in law enforcement and security sectors. The global market for advanced security screening solutions is projected to exceed $10 billion by 2025, with the addressable segment for this THz imaging technology estimated at $2-3 billion annually. Beyond security applications, the core technology has broader impacts across a diverse set of industries, potentially unlocking a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity. The successful commercialization of this THz technology promises to create high-skilled jobs in engineering and manufacturing while strengthening U.S. competitiveness in emerging semiconductor technologies. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative approach to overcoming current limitations in THz imaging systems. The research objectives focus on addressing key technical challenges, including the design of a high-performance signal generator, development of a suitable product enclosure, and creation of effective signal processing models. The research will involve approaches such as advanced signal processing, electromagnetics modeling, artificial intelligence, and system integration to achieve a fully functional minimum viable product. Anticipated technical results include demonstration of necessary product-level signal generation capabilities, packaging, and signal processing capabilities. This project has the potential to significantly advance the field of THz imaging, enabling new capabilities in non-invasive sensing and opening possibilities for numerous scientific and commercial applications beyond security screening.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
