 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: Achieving superconductivity under an ambience environment is one of the holy grails in physics because it would drastically improve energy efficiency by eliminating energy loss due to resistance. This project builds upon the complementary expertise of two scientists to identify signatures of superconducting pairing symmetries. The team aims to shed light on how various symmetries govern the onset of superconductivity in different classes of superconductors using a nonlinear optical measurement method called second harmonic generation. This technique is highly sensitive to symmetry changes in crystalline materials. Combined with other electronic and magnetic property measurements, the scientists can provide insights and guidance on how to potentially custom design materials capable of hosting superconductivity under less cold conditions. The research team is dedicated to attracting and engaging young minds to the field of physics through expanding outreach activities. The collaborative research offers necessary education for preparing undergraduate and graduate students for the next quantum technology revolution and the needed workforce for economic growth in South Carolina. \r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: This research project is designed to experimentally investigate the bulk and surface physical properties of unconventional superconductors to expose new phases, especially broken symmetries. This project builds upon the complementary expertise of two scientists, in optical, electronic, and magnetic surface and bulk characterizations of selected layered materials that exhibit superconductivity, to explore the manifestations of broken symmetries below the superconducting transition temperature. The focus of this research project centers on using materials symmetry (space and time) and broken translational symmetry (surface and interface) as guiding principles for discovering and understanding the superconducting properties. As the electron pairing symmetry is inherently tied to the underlying electronic structure, the crystallographic and time-reversal symmetries can impose constraints on the pairing symmetry.  Investigation of various symmetries can provide insights into the mechanisms leading to unconventional superconductivity. The combined skills uniquely position the team to distinguish between surface and bulk physical properties, as their similarities and differences can reveal fundamental aspects of superconductivity and guide the development of next-generation electronic technologies. Ultimately, this research is aimed to shed light on how electrons organize themselves to achieve superconductivity and potentially push the boundaries of known materials towards the discovery of new superconductors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
