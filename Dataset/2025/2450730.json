 "awd_abstract_narration": "All languages have syntax, which allows smaller units, like words, to be combined into larger units, like sentences. Syntax is a primary method of communicating between speakers. Languages differ syntactically in restricted ways, and the dividing line between sentence and word is an important area of research. The formation of words in some languages is complex and, despite decades of research, is still not completely understood. Part of the reason why is that there are incomplete tools and data for answering these questions, including a lack of detailed syntactic descriptions. Such descriptions are important not only for linguistic typology and theory, but also for other benefits including educational opportunities and refinement of artificial intelligence (AI) and other language technologies.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates syntax in a language for which a detailed description of lexical structure exists. This project approaches the study of syntax in two ways, through the study of sentences in recordings of natural speech, supplemented with questions to speakers about possible and impossible sentences and their meanings. The project transcribes and translates narratives, then posts them with their audio or video on a website so that the widest possible audience can read, understand and enjoy the language. The entire corpus of data collected during the project is archived in a publicly accessible archive, which may help future investigators find answers to questions not imagined in the current project. New words from the recordings are incorporated into an already-substantial dictionary draft. The project yields a syntactic description and a dictionary, and a website of texts. The results from this project have broad applicability in linguistics, history, anthropology, and other disciplines and provide innovative educational opportunities that build capacity for linguistic research in a non-academic setting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
