 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU targets critical advanced technologies including aviation, marine propulsion, and power generation, while simultaneously developing a robust US-based workforce with skills to advance their careers. Addressing challenges in these technologies requires both deep fundamental research and strong connections with industry, which are hallmarks of Penn State\u2019s approach to research. This REU site renewal builds off the successes of a prior site (grant EEC-2149667) that has a proven track record of engaging students in high-impact research, meaningful interactions with industry professionals, and developing career skills, all while doing rigorous human-subjects research on the impact that REU experiences can have on students\u2019 attitudes towards research. This project will provide 10 REU students with a unique and enriching experience that encompasses research, professional development, and networking. A student cohort from a range of schools will spend 10 weeks at Penn State. A number of research-related activities, including lab and facility tours, industry workshops, and a research symposium at the Site's industry partner, Pratt and Whitney, will provide students with a broader view of research beyond their own individual project. Students will also participate in workshops on technical communication, applying for jobs in industry or graduate school, and fellowship applications to provide students with the skills to transfer their research experiences to career outcomes. Mentoring from faculty, near-peer graduate students, and industry professionals will provide REU students with a strong support network both during and after the summer experience.\r\n\r\nThe site will provide each student with compelling research on topics that range from fundamental to applied in areas such as fluid mechanics, material science, heat transfer, manufacturing, combustion, sensor development, and high-performance computations. Proposed projects include high-impact topics like design for additive manufacturing, infrared thermal imaging for efficiency improvements, advanced design of grid-level battery storage, and use of alternative fuels for grid resilience and fuel security. Because the project involves faculty with a range of expertise and laboratories, students will use the latest research tools such as metal additive manufacturing, machine learning, high-speed diagnostics, and more. The success of the REU site will be assessed by experts in engineering education using qualitative and quantitative formative, summative, and longitudinal research methods, which correspond with a rigorous educational research plan to meet critical gaps in engineering education literature. In addition to ensuring the quality of the site, the team will also seek to translate what they learn to the scholarly community more broadly. This evaluation method, based in rigorous engineering education theory, will build on the team's prior research to provide data to both the REU site and in the open literature, improving REU outcomes for all NSF REU sites. Overall, this REU site will provide a cohort of students with a unique and impactful summer experience while informing them about the power and propulsion industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
