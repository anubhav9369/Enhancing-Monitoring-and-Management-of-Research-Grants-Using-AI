 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Brian H. Clowers of Washington State University leads a team of researchers developing a tractable, high-performance analytical platform to explore chemical structure and behavior in the gas phase. Built using economical printed circuit board (PCB) technologies, these systems are expected to enable scientists to separate and analyze molecules based on subtle differences in shape, charge, and chemical reactivity\u2014capabilities essential to fields ranging from medical diagnostics to materials chemistry. The ability to isolate and study different molecular forms in the gas phase will provide critical insight into chemical processes that are not accessible by traditional solution-based methods. This project will emphasize workforce development through direct student engagement in instrument design, data analysis, and experimental planning. The open-source dissemination of hardware and software components aims to ensure broad impact across academic, industrial, and educational communities, contributing to national capacity in measurement science.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the project will apply modular, PCB-based ion manipulation systems to advance gas-phase separation methods and ion chemistry through three main objectives: (I) characterizing structural heterogeneity of fragment ions formed after ion activation; (II) examining site-specific solvent interactions and isotope exchange kinetics to study the initial stages of solvation; and (III) conducting ion-ion reactions to evaluate chemical reactivity under conditions not accessible with conventional instruments. These systems will support extended ion residence times and controlled gas-phase reaction environments following multidimensional separations. Project outcomes will inform the design of new analytical workflows that enhance measurement sensitivity and selectivity, supporting the characterization of complex mixtures in fields such as structural biology, synthetic chemistry, and molecular analysis. In carrying out these research activities, participants will engage advanced chemical instrumentation, experimental design, and data interpretation\u2014experiences that are expected to strengthen technical expertise and support future contributions to the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
