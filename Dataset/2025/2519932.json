 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together four regional public universities with a shared commitment to advancing innovation and economic development in their respective communities. While each institution has already established research centers and innovation hubs, these efforts have often operated in silos, disconnected from both local industry needs and academic programs. By collaborating, the universities aim to build stronger, more integrated relationships with regional businesses, provide students and faculty with meaningful opportunities to engage in real-world problem-solving, and support the growth of emerging technologies and startups. The overarching objective is to create robust pathways for students and communities to thrive in the evolving technology-driven economy.\r\n\r\nThe collaborative initiative seeks to contribute to the enhancement of regional innovation ecosystems by developing shared strategies for external engagement and industry collaboration. Recognizing the unique role regional universities play in understanding and responding to local priorities, the project will work to dismantle institutional silos, map innovation assets within each region, and implement formalized practices for building sustainable external partnerships. Faculty, students, industry leaders, and regional businesses will be actively involved in fostering new collaborations, thus creating vibrant networks that align academic expertise with industry demand. By modeling \"centers of gravity\" for innovation in four distinct regions, the cohort will generate scalable insights and share best practices with peer institutions nationwide. ComPEET aims to strengthen the translational research and development capacity, support tech startups and industry partners, and contribute to stronger and resilient regional economies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
