 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project prepares the next generation of U.S. environmental scientists and engineers by providing them with the scientific and engineering skills required for addressing pressing challenges of anaerobic digestion (AD), a process that utilizes microorganisms to transform wastes into natural gas, electricity, and heat. This technology has historically been used as a tool in wastewater treatment, but its use for managing agricultural wastes and food waste has increased significantly in the past two decades. Despite its growing use, several challenges remain to realize the full potential of this technology to maximize energy recovery. In this IRES project, graduate and undergraduate students from the United States participate in a 6-week research experience in Canada, with opportunities to explore, discover, decipher, develop, evaluate, and engage in the advancement of AD biotechnology through novel approaches aimed at improving utilization of waste and increasing production of energy. The mentoring team of this integrated, interdisciplinary research, education, and professional development program includes U.S. researchers (Veera Gnaneswar Gude - Purdue University Northwest; Mohammad Marufuzzaman - Mississippi State University; and Matthew Scarborough \u2013 University of Vermont) and Canadian researchers from The University of Alberta and Toronto Metropolitan University.\r\n\r\nThe research experiences focus on understanding (i) the microbiological processes/key players (microbiome) responsible for successful AD operations under various chemical stressors, (ii) potential impacts of micro/ nanoplastics and antibiotic resistant genes on AD of sludge; (iii) the role of electro-assisted AD for bioproduct recovery; (iv) the impacts of micro/nano bubble aeration, mixing and operating temperature on AD performance; and (v) the potential of Artificial Intelligence for AD process monitoring and optimization; and process modeling for resource recovery and management. In addition to the immersive scientific research experience, the student participants gain global perspectives of sustainable environmental biotechnologies in different cultural, geographic, and regulatory settings, thereby preparing them for professional careers in diverse research environments and engineering practice. After the international travel, the student participants reflect and share their experiences with other graduate and undergraduate students at the U.S. institutions to catalyze motivation for the next round of research students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
