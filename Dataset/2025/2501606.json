 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the travel expenses for two researchers to work with communities on the management of data from a vast audio-visual record collected over a 50-year period. Specifically, the researchers are exploring best practices for coordinating with Indigenous communities in the digitization and annotation of visual materials.  Existing metadata and contextual information in those records are being updated as well. The project\u2019s central objectives are centered around improving the public\u2019s understanding of anthropological science and the scientific method, by optimizing practices for the communication of data and findings to wider audiences. The activities also improve infrastructure for the preservation, storage, and access of scientific materials for future use, and building capacity for scientific engagement with Indigenous communities.  \r\n\r\nThe activities advance scientific understanding of appropriate data management and sharing practices involving Indigenous groups, exploring how to best integrate the requirements that data involving Indigenous communities to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), while also adhering to the CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles for data governance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Documentary Educational Resources (DER) staff met with researchers, curators and stakeholders in South Africa and Namibia to gain a better understanding of archiving and curation of audiovisual archives documenting San (&ldquo;Bushmen&rdquo;) communities. A second set of activities focused on gathering feedback from stakeholders on the Marshall Audiovisual Archive, an extensive collection of films and photography documenting the Ju/hoan community in Nyae Nyae, Namibia, over a 50-year period. The feedback was focused on informing DER&rsquo;s ongoing stewardship of the films.</p>\r\n<p>The Marshall archive includes documentation of the Nyae Nyae community through the 1950s and early 1960s, during their final years subsisting by hunting and gathering. This early material was produced during the Marshall Expeditions (a series of scientific expeditions co-sponsored by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Smithsonian Institution in the 1950s). Ongoing research and filmmaking by John Marshall through the early 2000s extended the film record, and chronicles the massive cultural change brought about by intensive contact with European and other southern African communities in the decades leading up to and after independence struggles in Namibia. The archive is unparalleled in its documentation of a single hunting and gathering community and as a longitudinal study of change. The films are used extensively in teaching at the university level and the archive overall continues to be of ongoing interest to anthropologists and others interested in understanding human history.</p>\r\n<p>Previously, little attention has been given to the use of the audiovisual archives in ongoing research or for the development of new lines of inquiry. The research trip provided ample evidence of the potential for and effectiveness of photo-elicitation methods and community feedback sessions in producing new anthropological data. These sessions enabled the research team to update existing metadata, served as a focal point for understanding the formation of pan-San identities and offered a means of surfacing community constructions of local history.&nbsp; Insights gained from the research trip will be integrated into future iterations of materials developed to accompany the films in
