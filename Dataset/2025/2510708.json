 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Major Research Instrumentation project supports the acquisition of a new magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrument, the MEGIN TRIUS Neo with an integrated helium recycler. MEG is a functional brain imaging technology that provides exquisite sensitivity to the timing of brain activity and is a direct measure of neuronal currents. The technology is complementary to other neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, which has high spatial sensitivity but limited sensitivity to rapid changes in brain dynamics. The MEG instrumentation is critical for supporting cognitive neuroscience research. Sample planned projects that use the instrument include new research to gain further insight into the development of brain and behavior in children, examination of the dynamics of memory systems, elucidation of how brain stimulation enhances brain function and behavior, and investigation of the role of sleep for cognitive and behavioral outcomes across the lifespan.\r\n\r\nThe MEGIN TRIUS Neo is a high-channel density, commercially available MEG system that provides high sensitivity to weak signals allowing for measurement of deep structures and low amplitude signals. The equipment also dramatically reduces use of helium, a limited resource. By combining MEG data with structural information obtained with magnetic resonance imaging, new knowledge is obtained by understanding how brain function and structure relate to outcomes across the population. The goals of some research supported by this instrumentation is translational and aims to inform understanding of the brain to improve health and outcomes for all. Other research supported by this instrumentation uses artificial intelligence to interpret these complex datasets to enhance the understanding of the links between brain and behavior. Overall, the instrumentation will provide significant research and training opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
