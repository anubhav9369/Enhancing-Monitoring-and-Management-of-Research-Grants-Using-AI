 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a high-velocity cold spray manufacturing system at Oklahoma State University (OSU) to advance multidisciplinary research, education, and training in advanced manufacturing. Cold spray manufacturing enables 3D printing of net-shaped structures with complex geometries, the deposition of coatings to enhance surface properties, and the repair of damaged components. The research enabled by this equipment looks to address challenges in applying cold spray to a wide range of engineering materials and applications, potentially leading to faster, more economical, resource-efficient, and energy-saving manufacturing processes. The equipment will support research projects of multiple investigators and students across OSU and partner regional universities. It will also be made available to researchers at a nearby U.S. Air Force base as well as to manufacturing, aerospace, and advanced materials industries, and scientists from national laboratories. Additionally, the equipment will support the education and career development of multiple early-career faculty, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates by providing access to advanced manufacturing capabilities. It will also facilitate experiential learning opportunities in multiple courses across mechanical, materials, aerospace, and industrial engineering programs. \r\n \r\nThe cold spray manufacturing system seeks to enable new fundamental research in advanced manufacturing, integrating mechanics, materials science, fluid dynamics, surface engineering, tribology, and bioengineering. The research projects supported by this award include investigations into the physics of impact bonding of microparticles; high strain rate deformation mechanics of metals and polymers; multiphase flows consisting of solid particles in gas; microstructure evolution in nonequilibrium solid-phase processing of metals; mechanisms of wear and corrosion under extreme environments; regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation on implant surfaces; and data-driven modeling for additive manufacturing. These coordinated multidisciplinary research efforts aim to close critical knowledge gaps in processing-microstructure-properties relationships in cold spray, guide the design and processing of high-performance alloys, polymers, and composites, and enable predictive models for large format additive manufacturing using cold spray. The innovative research projects, along with the educational and training programs, will contribute to both advancing fundamental knowledge and developing a skilled workforce in the critical area of advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
