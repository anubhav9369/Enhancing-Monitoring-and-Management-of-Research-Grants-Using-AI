 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving curricula for teaching quantum concepts in physics and many other disciplinary contexts. Quantum science and engineering is a fast-growing, high-priority field for national security and technological innovation. Developing the workforce for it is important for America's economic future. Topics in quantum science and engineering are taught in an increasingly broad array of courses across many disciplines and educational levels. Yet it remains difficult for many students and educators to access effective, engaging learning tools. This project aims to develop and modernize a suite of research-based computer simulations, along with adaptable, field-tested teaching materials, for teaching quantum concepts. These free resources will support a broad audience of students and educators, helping prepare learners from all backgrounds for future opportunities in quantum science and engineering. This work is supported as a Level 3 project in the Engaged Student Learning track of NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EDU) program.\r\n\r\nPhET interactive simulations are based on extensive education research and encourage students to learn through exploration and discovery in a game-like environment. In this project, a team of investigators at the University of Colorado at Boulder and California State University, Fullerton, will redesign and modernize at least six PhET sims covering a variety of core quantum topics, including quantum wave interference, the photoelectric effect, quantum bound states, double wells and covalent bonds, band structure, and quantum tunneling and wave packets. Each sim will be paired with research-based teaching materials, including in-class activities, guiding questions, tutorials, and homework exercises. The investigators intend to build a broad community of educators and learners to support the ongoing use and improvement of the materials. They will study how undergraduate students learn with these tools across a range of institutions, disciplines, and backgrounds. Their education research will address questions such as the following: How do students reason about quantum concepts while using sims, and how does this vary by background and STEM discipline? How do the sims, coupled with the other teaching materials, affect students' learning and engagement across different educational levels, departments, and institutions? How do students' backgrounds and mathematical preparation impact their learning using these tools? How do faculty use PhET resources in their teaching, and what helps support effective uses? The NSF IUSE: EDU program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
