 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a first-of-its-kind assistive technology that provides real-time, independent communication access for people with complex communication, sensory, or accessibility needs. This innovation addresses a critical gap that prevents millions of individuals from independently accessing the internet, receiving emergency alerts, participating fully in education, or communicating without reliance on human intermediaries. The Tatum Signing System (TSS) is designed to promote autonomy and privacy. Commercially, the project targets a serviceable $1.4 billion market across home, educational, workplace, and healthcare applications, with strong interest from national distribution programs that provide assistive technology at no cost to end-users. In addition, the project advances research in tactile language translation and compliant robotics, with potential applications in adjacent fields such as prosthetics, soft robotics, human-computer interaction, and inclusive product design.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a compliant robotic system designed to advance inclusive communication and accessibility technologies for people of all abilities. Building on prior work demonstrating early robotic communication prototypes, this project now seeks to enable more natural, multimodal outputs that integrate movement, spatial awareness, and touch-based feedback. Research objectives include designing a compliant, safe four DOF arm, refining adaptive software that can translate written language into accessible outputs, and integrating haptic feedback to support interactive, two-way exchanges. Technical validation will be conducted with a diverse group of users representing a wide range of communication preferences and accessibility needs to ensure clarity, safety, and effectiveness. Tatum Robotics anticipates that this customizable system will expand empower people everywhere to engage independently with digital content, essential services, and interpersonal communication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
