 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will support the acquisition of a hierarchical testing framework to enable component-level and system-level validation of power and energy systems at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-Dearborn). This state-of-the-art instrumentation will significantly advance multidisciplinary research, education, and training in electrical, computer, robotics, mechanical, and industrial engineering. It will offer broad access to faculty and students, delivering hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies, while also benefiting external collaborators from academia and industry across Metro Detroit. The framework will strengthen UM-Dearborn\u2019s regional and national impact by accelerating innovation in smart grids, energy storage, electric vehicles, and power electronics.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchical framework will enable comprehensive testing from individual components to full system integrations, supporting rigorous design validation and the development of advanced control and optimization algorithms. It will bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment, producing reliable solutions that foster trust among key regional industry partners. Furthermore, the framework supports the incorporation of novel machine learning algorithms into power and energy research by producing rich datasets for model verification, thereby improving system reliability and stability. As a shared, multi-user platform, it promotes collaborative projects and delivers comprehensive training for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and K-12 participants through dedicated STEM outreach programs. Ultimately, this acquisition will serve as a critical catalyst for expanding UM-Dearborn\u2019s research infrastructure and workforce development initiatives in the rapidly evolving power and energy sector.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
