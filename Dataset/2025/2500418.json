 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid adoption of hybrid and electric vehicle (EV) technologies in recent years compels industry leaders and educators to rethink current approaches to automotive instruction, ensuring the next generation of skilled technicians is equipped to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving industry. This project at Jefferson Community and Technical College (JCTC) will provide students and educators at both secondary and post-secondary levels with tools to advance their understanding of EV safety, maintenance, and repair. By developing instructional materials that allow instructors to leverage existing resources, this project enhances curriculum access and empowers institutions to keep pace with technological advancements. Over the course of the project 120 secondary and 90 post-secondary students will gain valuable, industry-aligned education and credentials that prepare them for high-demand, sustainable careers in the automotive sector. By fostering innovation and creating new educational pathways, the project contributes to meeting regional and national workforce needs.\r\n\r\nThe project's overall goal is to create a scalable and comprehensive program to train students for careers in hybrid and EV technologies. To that end, JCTC will establish its first Hybrid and EV Technician Certificate, integrating industry-driven skills, safety standards, and evidence-based teaching practices. The College will expand its Industry Advisory Committee (IAC) by 12 additional members to broaden industry partnerships and to guide the curriculum's alignment with their evolving needs. A professional development (PD) program for 10 secondary and five post-secondary instructors will be developed and piloted, enabling faculty to teach EV safety and repair using existing resources. This PD program will include bi-monthly virtual follow-ups and site visits to ensure successful implementation. The project will also develop and disseminate open-source instructional materials, including supplemental modules tailored to institutions with limited access to EV technology. These resources will make EV instruction more accessible nationwide. Guided by an Industry Engagement Strategic Plan, the program will align with workforce demands, incorporating feedback from regional employer surveys. By the end of the project, 15 instructors and over 200 students are expected to complete the program and over 300 students will be exposed to EV technology; supplemental materials will be made available for scaling to other institutions statewide. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which supports the education of technicians in advanced-technology fields essential to the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
