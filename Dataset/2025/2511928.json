 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Wyoming (UWyo) to support the acquisition of a STELLARIS8 FALCON STED super-resolution fluorescence lifetime confocal microscope. This advanced imaging system will significantly enhance research capacity at UWyo, building on the university\u2019s recent $100 million investment in STEM research infrastructure. The instrument will also play a transformative role in education and outreach. It will provide hands-on training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students across Wyoming and neighboring states, while supporting K\u201314 STEM engagement through established partnerships with local schools and community colleges. High school students and teachers throughout the state will benefit through workshops and outreach initiatives. The university is committed to maintaining this instrument with dedicated technical support and integrating it into existing facilities for imaging, plant growth, and data analysis.\r\n\r\nThe microscope will enable researchers to explore cellular and molecular processes in real time, especially under changing environmental conditions. It will promote interdisciplinary collaborations, expand scientific capabilities, and open new avenues for discovery across fields such as plant biology, microbiology, and environmental sciences. It will facilitate major advances in understanding plant health, microbial interactions, and survival mechanisms in extreme environments. Supporting research at both UWyo and Colorado State University, the microscope is expected to serve more than 20 research groups within a few years and become a key resource for scientific innovation in the region. By making this powerful technology broadly accessible, the project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers and contribute to discoveries that improve our understanding of life and benefit society as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
