 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of undergraduate students enrolled at HBCUs so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project contributes to HBCU-UP program goals by addressing the national need to enhance data science education and research capacity. With the goals of improving student outcomes in core data science courses and expanding undergraduate research opportunities, this project is implementing a hybrid supplemental instruction model and faculty-mentored summer research experiences at Claflin University. This work contributes to national priorities in education by enhancing supportive learning environments for undergraduate STEM students and integrating applied data science across STEM disciplines. Expected outcomes include improved academic achievement, retention, and preparation for careers and advanced study in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe project uses an integrated approach to data science education and research training by developing and implementing a hybrid supplemental instruction model for core data science courses. The model increases access to supplemental instruction, leveraging Claflin University\u2019s existing information technology infrastructure to provide synchronous online and in-classroom instructional supports. This model also advances competency-based education with an increased focus on demonstration of student learning. Study groups are led by supplemental instruction leaders who identify specific learning outcomes for participants. Students are able to demonstrate acquired knowledge and skills, attempt competencies multiple times, and receive continuous feedback from the group leader. Summer research internships for rising juniors and seniors enhance research capabilities through the application of data science in various STEM fields. The research opportunities are unique in their focus on data analysis applications in STEM and their connection to external collaborators and current projects at Claflin University, funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as industry and government laboratories. Student contributions are expected to yield valuable results for clients, publishable research findings, and research presentations at professional meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
