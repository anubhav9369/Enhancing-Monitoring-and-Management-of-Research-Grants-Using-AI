 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean beneath Antarctica\u2019s sea ice plays a critical role in Earth\u2019s system and supports unique polar ecosystems, yet it remains one of the least studied parts of the planet. This project focuses on understanding how turbulent mixing in the ocean moves heat, nutrients, and other properties between layers of water. These processes influence the stability of Antarctic ice shelves, the productivity of marine ecosystems, and the ocean\u2019s ability to store heat. By collecting new observations from a rarely visited region in the western Weddell Sea, where thick multi-year sea ice hinders the access of research vessels, this research will improve scientific understanding of how the Antarctic Ocean functions. \r\n\r\nThe research will quantify turbulence and vertical mixing processes in the western Weddell Sea, a region characterized by dense water formation, thick sea ice cover, and strong ocean currents. Microstructure profilers will be deployed from the German research icebreaker RV Polarstern to collect direct measurements of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation. The study will examine the influence of tides, topography, and wind forcing on mixing rates and evaluate their effects on vertical fluxes of heat and nutrients. Observations will be used to estimate diapycnal diffusivities across a range of environmental conditions, vertical heat and nutrient fluxes. Results from this project are anticipated improve model predictions of ocean\u2013ice interactions and contribute to a better understanding of the Antarctic system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
