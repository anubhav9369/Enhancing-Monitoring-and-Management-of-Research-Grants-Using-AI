 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jupiter\u2019s early formation in the Solar System is thought to have influenced how the inner, rocky planets formed, particularly their complement of non-rocky materials like water and light gases.  If we see sculpting effects of giant planets on their sibling planets in a statistical sample of planetary systems around other stars, it will teach us about planet formation in general and set the context for understanding our own place in the universe.  This project will use spectroscopy to track the motions of stars known to host giant planets like Jupiter, to determine whether they have inner planets. Secondly, it will determine whether the compositions of the atmospheres of such inner planets depend on the presence and orbital properties of outer, giant planets. It includes an educational component designed to encourage persistence of physics and astrophysics majors.\r\n\r\nThis research uses the Keck Planet Finder spectrograph to look for the radial velocity signatures of planets, to correlate the inner planets to the giants in the same systems.  It will also take an inventory of volatiles via transmission spectra of transiting planets, using data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. The atmospheric properties of sub-Neptunes with and without giant planets will be compared to determine the giants\u2019 impact. At the University of New Mexico, research experiences will be tied to the curriculum, there will be a career paths website and alumni visits to help physics and astrophysics majors to network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
