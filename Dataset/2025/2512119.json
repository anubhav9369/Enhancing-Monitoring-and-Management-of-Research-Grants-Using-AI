 "awd_abstract_narration": "PFAS (short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are man-made chemicals used in many products like non-stick pans, waterproof clothing, and firefighting foam. They are popular because they resist heat, water, and oil. However, that is also what makes them a potential problem \u2014 they don\u2019t break down easily in the environment. Over time, PFAS can build up in water, soil, animals, and even people, and they may be harmful to our health. Removing PFAS from water is challenging. Most regular water treatment methods do not work well, especially when the water is full of other waste materials. This project is exploring a new way to get rid of PFAS using a low-temperature plasma \u2014 a special kind of energized gas. This plasma creates particles that can break the very strong bonds in PFAS chemicals, helping to destroy them. The research will test different plasma systems and water types to understand how PFAS break down. The goal is to create a reliable, large-scale method that can remove PFAS from water completely. This work could help solve a serious environmental problem and protect people\u2019s health. It supports the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission to advance science and improve life for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the mechanisms of PFAS degradation in complex aqueous matrices via non-equilibrium plasma. The central hypothesis is that non-oxidative plasma-induced mechanisms, driven by electron and photon interactions, yield transient hydrofluorocarbons that are subsequently oxidized by hydroxyl radicals to release fluoride ions. The research is organized into four tasks: optimizing plasma parameters to enhance electron and photon fluxes to the gas-liquid interface; developing analytical techniques for detecting PFAS and byproducts; redesigning reactors to improve efficiency; and applying machine learning to analyze data and guide optimization. This research will advance understanding of plasma-liquid interactions and support the development of a feedstock-agnostic plasma process capable of PFAS defluorination across diverse matrices. Broader impacts include K-12 STEM outreach, development of environmental case studies, and integration of research findings into interdisciplinary training programs. Stakeholder engagement will be promoted through public talks, workshops, and a data-sharing platform to support evidence-based policy.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by 1) Process Systems, Reaction Engineering and Molecular Thermodynamics program, 2) Environmental Engineering program and 3) the Environmental Sustainability program in response to the Dear Colleague Letter 24-130, as part of the ECosystem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) interdisciplinary program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
