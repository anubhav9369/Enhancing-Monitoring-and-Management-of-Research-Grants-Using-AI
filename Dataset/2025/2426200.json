 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network, or SuperDARN, is an international collaborative experiment for observations of plasma motions in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. By observing ionospheric plasma motions, a multitude of geophysical processes are being studied. These processes range from fundamental plasma instabilities to the global-scale plasma response to changes in the solar-terrestrial environment. Each of these areas of study contributes to developing an understanding of the coupling of energy from the Sun into Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere and its effects on humanity and technological systems. \r\n\r\nThis project will support operations and maintenance of the U.S. SuperDARN radars in the northern hemisphere by the consortium of Penn State University, Virginia Tech, Dartmouth College, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The collaboration operates twelve radars that cover a vast region from Alaska to Iceland at high latitudes, and Oregon to Virginia at middle latitudes. In addition to operation and maintenance activities, the project will support a program of research that exploits new capabilities that have been developed over the last several years. This includes providing improved fidelity in measurements (plasma convection mapping and imaging), extending the area over which measurements are obtained (bistatic observations), and providing new types of measurements (sounding). SuperDARN has a long-standing commitment to including graduate students in all aspects of the program. The SuperDARN observations are also important for space weather applications since HF radio propagation is sensitive to perturbations in the bottomside ionosphere, e.g., solar flares.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
