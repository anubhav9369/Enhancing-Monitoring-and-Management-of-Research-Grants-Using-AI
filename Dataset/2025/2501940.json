 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site at SUNY Binghamton supports middle and high school teachers from rural communities, especially those who teach students with disabilities, by immersing them in cutting-edge microelectronics research. Through a summer research experience, teachers will work directly with university researchers and engineers, gaining hands-on knowledge of microelectronics technologies and practices. They will bring this experience back to their classrooms, creating more engaging and relevant lessons that introduce students to careers in microelectronics. By offering access to these opportunities, the program will help cultivate a larger pool of highly skilled technical talent to support our region\u2019s growing role in the national microelectronics industry.\r\n\r\nThis RET site will engage secondary STEM and special education teachers in authentic research experiences focused on microelectronics engineering. Working alongside faculty and graduate students, participants will develop a deeper understanding of engineering practices central to the microelectronics field, including semiconductor processing, materials characterization, and electronics packaging. The program will support the development of curricular modules and experiential learning opportunities such as cleanroom tours, lab exercises, and industry-site visits that other educators can adapt. It will contribute to educational research by examining how immersive research experiences inform teachers\u2019 instructional practices and curricular design. With a focus on rural and special education teachers, this effort aims to better align classroom learning with the technical skills required for careers in microelectronics manufacturing and design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
