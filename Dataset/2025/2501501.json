 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lithium-ion batteries are the backbone of modern electric vehicles (EVs) and play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy-efficient transportation. Vibration is an inherent and inevitable operating condition for on-board EV batteries. The effects of vibration on battery performance are poorly understood because vibration can affect several battery internal degradation mechanisms. These degradation processes directly reduce vehicle travel range and overall battery life. This project will use experiments and modeling to uncover the intricate mechanisms of battery degradation triggered by vibration, including structural and stress evolution, which often take place simultaneously with chemical degradation and accelerated battery capacity loss. The results of the project will inform the design of safer, more durable, and higher performance batteries. The interdisciplinary nature of this research, combining electrochemistry, materials science, and mechanical engineering, could inspire new collaborative research efforts and educational initiatives, fostering the development of a skilled workforce in the critical field of energy storage technology.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate vibration-induced degradation in Lithium-ion battery cells using a comprehensive approach that integrates systematic experimental studies with electrochemical modeling. The project will characterize both short-term and long-term degradation processes by examining the interplay between mechanical and chemical changes under dynamic vibration conditions. The research is structured to focus on three primary components: (1) experimental investigation of the vibration-induced integrated degradation in lithium-ion batteries; (2) modeling study of internal chemical degradation under vibration conditions; (3) modeling study of irreversible mechanical degradation under vibration conditions. By integrating experimental results with electrochemical models, this project will establish a unified framework for understanding vibration-induced degradation pathways. The mathematical models and experimental methods developed in this project are expected to serve as valuable tools for battery researchers in testing and design. Furthermore, by contributing to the optimal management and control of battery operations, this research supports more efficient energy usage, aligning with broader societal goals of energy conservation and sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
