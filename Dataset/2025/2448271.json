 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowship project aims to serve the national need of preparing and retaining highly-qualified STEM teachers to support K\u201312 education and workforce development in response to the rapid growth of domestic microelectronics and semiconductor industries. Additionally, this project plans to support 15 practicing STEM teachers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by offering leadership development, mentoring, and opportunities to co-design and implement locally relevant STEM initiatives. The proposed project components are positioned to enable high-achieving practicing teachers to become STEM teacher leaders with the capacity to engage students in innovative STEM learning experiences and to strengthen educational pathways that align with the evolving needs of regional microelectronics ecosystems in Idaho and New York.\r\n\r\nThis project at Boise State University and the University of Rochester includes partnerships with rural and urban high-need school districts in Idaho and New York; the Industrial Associates Program at the University of Rochester; the Microelectronics Education and Research Center at Boise State University; and nonprofit organizations such as the Idaho STEM Action Center, the Idaho Rural Schools Association, and The Story Collider. Project goals include preparing and retaining 15 STEM teacher leaders over five years in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to support the emerging microelectronics and semiconductor ecosystems in both states. These practicing teachers will have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of microelectronics and semiconductors, enhance their leadership skills to promote educational innovation, and build communication competencies to support K\u201312 STEM initiatives tailored to local needs. Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory, the project emphasizes self-efficacy and outcome expectations to shape teachers\u2019 professional trajectories and their students\u2019 interest in STEM careers. This project is proposed to include an interactive evaluation component. Evaluation will be guided by the following questions: (a) In what ways do participants become integrated into the regional microelectronics and semiconductor ecosystems, and what is the relationship between these integrations and the project components? (b) To what degree did program participants advance their knowledge, skills, and dispositions in semiconductors and microelectronics based on program components? (c) In what ways did Noyce Fellows enact teacher leadership and how did program components contribute to these activities? (d) In what ways have Noyce Fellows advanced in communication skills to foster impactful engagement with students and community members? and (e) In what ways does a collaboration between institutions from different states benefit project participants, including project leaders? The results of this project will be disseminated to help enhance the field. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K\u201312 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K\u201312 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K\u201312 STEM teachers in high-need school districts. This project is funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and is supported in part by funds from the Micron Technology, Inc.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
