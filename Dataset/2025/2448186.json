 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Track 1 project aims to serve the national need of preparing highly qualified STEM teachers for rural school districts. This project will support 11 scholars majoring in mathematics and science by providing scholarships, mentorship, and place-based learning experiences. The proposed project components will enable high-achieving prospective teachers to become secondary STEM educators with deep expertise in culturally relevant, place-based instruction tailored to rural communities.\r\n\r\nThis project at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville includes partnerships with high-need school districts in the tristate region of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, as well as regional community colleges. Project goals include recruiting and preparing 11 new STEM teachers over five years, specifically in mathematics and science, and supporting them through a comprehensive program of scholarships, pedagogical training, and mentorship. The project intends to support undergraduate students and post-baccalaureate STEM majors committed to teaching in rural settings.\r\nEvaluation of the project are projected to be guided by the following research questions:\r\n\r\n(a)\tHow does participation in place-based learning experiences influence the development of teacher identity and commitment to rural teaching?\r\n(b)\tHow does the effect of location and personal connection to a region impact the recruitment and retention of mathematics and science teachers?\r\n(c)\tWhat is the perceived impact on student engagement and learning when place-based investigations are implemented?\r\n\r\nThis Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
