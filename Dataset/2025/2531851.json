 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement EPSCoR Research Fellows project provides a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a graduate student at Clemson University. This work is conducted in collaboration with National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Through the fellowship, the PI will develop advanced analytical approaches to fundamentally understand the formation mechanism during the synthesis of composite electrodes, as well as the degradation mechanism and working principles for solid-state batteries. This project aims to overcome interfacial issues through the microstructural and chemical design of the composite electrodes. Through the collaboration with the national synchrotron facility, the development of multi-modal characterization techniques can be integrated into the imaging facility at Clemson University, which can serve as an anchor capability and service to be made available to the national research community. Moreover, this fellowship project will serve as a mechanism to foster and train the next generation of material scientists in energy science and advanced characterization.\r\n\r\nRechargeable batteries play a crucial role as the leading energy storage devices and power sources for various applications. Solid-state batteries are considered promising in terms of thermal stability and safety, while the undesired interfacial reactions between solid-state electrolytes and electrodes hinder the wide adoption of the technique. The project will rationally design the solid-state batteries by elucidating the role of the solid electrolyte, cathode, and interface regarding battery performance. This project will investigate three key aspects: (1) the role of interdiffusion, phase transition, and microstructural evolution during solid state synthesis; (2) the intercalation and interfacial reactions during electrochemical degradation; and (3) the combination of synchrotron-based characterization techniques, the data-driven analysis, and the scientific interpretation with the power of artificial intelligence. This fellowship will greatly transform the career of the PI by providing unique opportunities for training, research, and establishing a sustainable partnership with collaborators. New modules on X-ray-based characterization methods will be introduced in existing undergraduate and graduate courses. This project will also contribute to the research infrastructure enhancement regarding X-ray imaging, aligning with a strategic plan for Clemson University and South Carolina. This project is supported by the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: EPSCoR Research Fellows, which supports early- and mid-career investigators in eligible jurisdictions to develop collaborations at the nation\u2019s private, government or academic research institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
