 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project focuses on the development of an artificial intelligence scientist system that automates biomedical research and development workflows. Current biomedical research processes are significantly hindered by labor-intensive manual operations, creating severe bottlenecks in experimental design and data analysis. The technology addresses these limitations by actively collaborating with scientists throughout the research process, from hypothesis generation through experimental execution to results interpretation. By integrating advanced language models with domain-specific biological knowledge, the system serves as an intelligent research partner across the entire scientific pipeline. The technology automates routine laboratory procedures, enhances experimental planning, and performs comprehensive data analysis, thereby reducing time spent on repetitive tasks while accelerating the generation of novel biomedical insights. This approach maintains rigorous scientific standards while dramatically improving research efficiency. The inefficiency in current biomedical research affects thousands of laboratories globally, resulting in wasted resources and significantly delayed scientific breakthroughs. The widespread adoption of this technology would accelerate development timelines for treatments targeting cancer, rare genetic diseases, and other critical health challenges, ultimately advancing public health outcomes and accelerating scientific progress.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a multi-agent architecture that enables complex task decomposition and sophisticated experimental planning through advanced computational modeling. The system implements chain-of-thought reasoning, reinforcement learning techniques, and retrieval-augmented generation to create intelligent agents that work alongside scientists in executing research workflows. By integrating natural language processing with specialized knowledge extracted from the peer-reviewed literature, the system generates scientifically valid experimental designs, offers predictive insights, and analyzes results with precision exceeding traditional approaches. The technology represents a fundamental advancement in computational biology by merging machine learning capabilities with deep biological domain expertise, ensuring all decisions align with established scientific principles while dramatically reducing time requirements for routine research activities. Scientists using this system benefit from substantially increased experimental throughput, enhanced reproducibility of results, and the ability to explore more hypotheses in less time, potentially transforming discovery rates across the biomedical sciences and accelerating innovations in human health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
