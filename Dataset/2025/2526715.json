 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy has advanced significantly in both fundamental research and commercial applications. However, chirality sensing, which is critical for biomedical sciences, remains largely underexplored. This proposed research aims to address key challenges in terahertz sensing, aiming to significantly amplify the chiral densities of plasmonic terahertz surface waves and consequently chiral-chiral interactions between the waves and a molecule so that they can become an enabling form of electromagnetic wave in the integrated terahertz sensing systems for biomedical applications. The innovations obtained from this research represent a technological breakthrough, which will usher in a new generation of functional terahertz sensing devices and components with greatly improved efficiency, bandwidth, miniaturization, and robustness to meet the needs of scientific, commercial and military sectors.\r\n\r\nThis research has two primary objectives: (1) to develop and experimentally demonstrate excitation mechanisms of chiral terahertz plasmonic surface waves; (2) to experimentally demonstrate chirality sensing with plasmonic surface waves in the terahertz regime. By achieving these objectives, the project will advance terahertz chirality sensing and plasmonic technologies, resulting in innovations such as polarization-controlled launching of chiral terahertz plasmonic surface waves, enhanced chirality sensing with improved chiral-chiral interactions, and novel meta-devices. This research will overcome grand challenges surrounding the spectroscopically important and underdeveloped terahertz regime by introducing a unique solution to experimentally launch chiral plasmonic surface waves and develop a groundbreaking terahertz sensing modality. Ultimately, this research will catalyze the emergence of a new field, terahertz chirality sensing, while fostering interdisciplinary training for the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
