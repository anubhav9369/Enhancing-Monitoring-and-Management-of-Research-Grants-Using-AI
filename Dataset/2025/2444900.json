 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study focuses on how engagement scholarship can impact research design, practices and approaches. The project traces the trajectories of robotics research as it is translated from the research lab to medical and commercial markets. The findings of this study inform robotics research practices as well as contribute to increased outcomes for local, state, and national audiences and markets of robotic assisted technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project designs and implements a series of professional development activities focused on needs assessment and translation planning with targeted audiences for robotics researchers. The research team tracks disciplinary effects of this intervention on the publications and research activities of the participating robotics researchers. Participating researchers are assessed for knowledge development through pre- and post- interviews. The findings of the study contribute to understanding how researchers who develop robotic assisted technologies can improve their research outcomes through engaged practices.\r\n\r\nThis project was funded by the Science and Technology Studies Program and the Ethical and Responsible Research Program in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
