 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern AI & robotics systems, such as general-purpose humanoid robots, must make intelligent decisions in real time, in unstructured environments. At the heart of these capabilities lies a fundamental problem: How can we compute optimal actions when such robotic systems are governed by highly complex dynamics (nonlinear, even discontinuous)? Traditional optimal control tools, while powerful, often fall short\u2014they can be slow, unreliable, or rely on overly simplified assumptions about the real physics. This project aims to advance a promising category of methods known as Sampling-Based Optimal Control, which has recently gained popularity due to its flexibility (can easily handle complex systems), scalability (can leverage massively parallel computation on GPUs), and empirical success in solving complex robotic planning and control problems. However, these methods currently lack a solid theoretical foundation and systematic design principles. This project will fill that gap by developing new mathematical frameworks to understand, analyze, and improve these method\u2014eventually leading to more reliable, efficient, and intelligent decision-making methods for real-world robotic and autonomous systems. By bridging theory and practice, this work supports NSF\u2019s mission to promote transformative research in AI & robotics, and has the potential to impact a wide range of fields where autonomous systems must operate reliably and effectively in the real world.\r\n\r\nOptimal control for complex nonlinear and contact\u2011rich systems is notoriously nonconvex and often discontinuous, rendering classical optimization tools computationally burdensome and prone to suboptimal local minima. Sampling\u2011Based Optimal Control (SBOC) has emerged as an attractive alternative because its stochastic trajectory rollouts handle severe nonlinearity, discontinuities, and intricate cost landscapes while exploiting GPU\u2011based parallelism; it now underpins path planning, robotic control, and model\u2011based RL. Yet SBOC remains largely empirical: there is a lack of principled guidance on parameter tuning, sampling schedules, and, crucially, theoretical guarantees of convergence or sub\u2011optimality. This project closes these gaps through three coordinated thrusts. Thrust\u202f1 develops asymptotic and finite\u2011time convergence theories that characterize when SBOC attains global optima and how performance scales with algorithmic and system parameters. Thrust\u202f2 translates these insights into new, more efficient algorithms via automated hyper\u2011parameter optimization and a diffusion\u2011style annealing strategy that accelerates exploration while preserving convergence. Thrust\u202f3 couples the resulting controllers with learned value functions, nominal policies, and dynamics models, yielding a powerful subroutine for model\u2011based reinforcement learning that unites the strengths of control and learning. The framework will be validated on demanding robotic benchmarks, including humanoid whole\u2011body locomotion and dexterous manipulation through extensive real hardware experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
