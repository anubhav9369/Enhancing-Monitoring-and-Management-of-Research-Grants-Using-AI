 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to develop novel advanced materials integrated with real-time process feedback, assisted by a machine learning algorithm, to enable scalable, autonomous in-situ manufacturing of electronics. The technology will provide capabilities for on-demand fabrication, adaptive repair, and dynamic reconfiguration of circuits, functions that are particularly critical for long-duration space missions where resupply is difficult. These enhanced materials and manufacturing processes will support future space exploration initiatives. Beyond space applications, the methods developed here may also transform multiple technology sectors including flexible hybrid electronics for wearable devices, neuromorphic computing systems that mimic brain functions, and distributed manufacturing solutions for remote or resource-limited environments. The research incorporates workforce development initiatives to train students in cutting-edge techniques spanning materials science, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing. Participants will gain hands-on experience in functional materials synthesis, intelligent process control systems, and semiconductor device fabrication, skills directly aligned with emerging needs in the advanced manufacturing sector. The project specifically addresses national workforce development priorities in critical technology areas including additive manufacturing, semiconductor processing, and autonomous production systems. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a new method to manufacture electronics in space using 2D materials like molybdenum disulfide (MoS\u2082). These ultra-thin materials are ideal for space applications because they are lightweight, radiation-resistant, and energy-efficient. The key innovation combines three critical components: (1) specially designed chemical inks that transform into functional electronics at relatively low temperatures, (2) an artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled printing system that adjusts in real-time to produce perfectly aligned layers, and (3) precision laser processing that fine tune the material's properties after printing. First, new ink materials and formulations will be created, where the molecular structure determines how well the material performs in final functional semiconductor devices. Then AI systems will be implemented to monitor and optimize the printing process, catching and correcting any defects in real-time. Finally, laser sintering will be utilized to control and enhance the material's electrical properties, enabling complete electronic device processing onsite. This integrated approach solves a major challenge in space manufacturing by eliminating the need for complex equipment or high temperature processing. The methods could enable in space manufacturing of electronics during long missions without relying on Earth-based supplies. The same technology may also improve manufacturing of flexible electronics and advanced computing systems on Earth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
