 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps project is based on the development of a sprayable silk-based wound dressing designed to simplify and improve the treatment of burn injuries. Current burn care often relies on painful, multi-step dressing applications that require frequent changes, skilled labor, and specialized materials, which is especially problematic in emergency, resource-limited, or high-acuity environments. This technology is a shelf-stable, hand-held spray that forms a transparent, conformal film directly over the wound site, eliminating the need for adhesives or secondary dressings. The bandage stays in place and is slowly resorbed to avoid damage associated with traditional bandage removal. In addition, this bandage may be used to carry medications to reduce infection risk and shorten hospital stays. This technology may improve medical care as well as patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of a silk-based hydrogel spray for wound care. The technology uses a silk fibroin formulation that undergoes aqueous aerosolization to instantly transition into a mechanically stable \u03b2-sheet, solid-state, porous matrix on contact with skin. The material forms a biodegradable, optically translucent dressing that becomes a protective yet breathable barrier, enabling continuous, non-invasive wound monitoring without removal. The silk matrix acts as a barrier against airborne bacteria, reducing infection risk while promoting angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory activity, while eliminating the need for dressing changes. This ambient-temperature process avoids the need for organic solvents, heat, or crosslinking agents. Unlike traditional dressings, this formulation adheres without external pressure, allows for real-time monitoring, and may be used to deliver antibiotics, growth factors, or biologics. In addition, this bandage is 100% biocompatible and may remain indefinitely without triggering an immune response while competing products that are reliant on silver-based antimicrobials are restricted to seven days of contact with skin. This technology may enhance patient outcomes, advance wound care, and minimize clinical burden.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
