 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site, Particle-Based Functional Materials for Energy, Sustainability, and Biomedicine, will support ten undergraduate students each summer (2026-8) in a ten-week immersive research experience.  The program recruits students from institutions with limited research opportunities \u2013 particularly those majoring in engineering, chemistry, physics, or mathematics \u2013 who are interested in exploring research as a pathway to graduate studies.  Participants (REU Fellows) will join engineering research groups and conduct independent projects that deepen their disciplinary knowledge while developing the ability to integrate concepts across fields.  In addition to hands-on research, fellows will engage in structured professional development activities designed to strengthen their communication skills, understanding of research ethics, career planning, and their growth mindset.\r\n\r\nModern scientific and engineering breakthroughs increasingly occur at the intersection of disciplines \u2013 particularly in biomedicine, sustainability, and energy.  This program centers on Particle-Based Functional Materials (PFM), an interdisciplinary domain that involves both computational and experimental studies of materials designed to perform specific functions.  These functions arise from the intrinsic properties of particles or the influence of particles on larger material structures.  PFM applications are broad and impactful, encompassing self-healing materials, controlled therapeutic delivery, smart catalysis, and advanced particle separations, among others.  This program prepares students to navigate these cross-cutting areas, emphasizing the need for future engineers to be nimble thinkers capable of working across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The PFM REU Site is grounded in the belief that future success in engineering and science requires both technical expertise and the ability to synthesize knowledge across domains.  To cultivate these skills, this program integrates traditional research experiences with a customized workshop series that emphasizes knowledge integration and mindset development.  By blending technical training with professional growth, the team aims to prepare students not only for graduate education but also for leadership in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
