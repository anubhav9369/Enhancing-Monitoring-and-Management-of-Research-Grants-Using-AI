 "awd_abstract_narration": "While generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools and methods could help researchers discover new insights about STEM teaching and learning, researchers face three major problems: First, they haven't been trained how to use these technologies in their research. Second, the training that exists is often too technical or not specific to STEM education research. Third, researchers at resource-limited colleges and universities have even fewer opportunities and resources to learn about GenAI than their colleagues at other institutions. These challenges could mean that talented researchers will be left behind as GenAI transforms how research is designed, conducted, and disseminated, ultimately slowing advancements in STEM education research. This project addresses these challenges by creating a training program that gives researchers at resource-limited institutions the skills they need to evaluate and use GenAI effectively, which will lead to better STEM education for all students and support the National Science Foundation's goal of advancing scientific progress. The project aims to teach early- and mid-career education researchers how to use GenAI to improve studies of how students learn science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. \r\n\r\nThis BCSER Institutes for Methods and Practices project is designed to build the GenAI capacities of early- and mid-career STEM education researchers by training 50 participants over the course of the institute. The project aims to (1) increase the number of researchers who can effectively, ethically, and responsibly use generative AI (GenAI) in their work; (2) strengthen participants\u2019 professional networks; and (3) expand the broader research community applying GenAI methods in STEM education. In Year 1, the team will design and launch the learning experience and curriculum. In Years 2 and 3, two cohorts of 25 researchers will engage in a year-long program that begins with a 5-day intensive, in-person training on GenAI tools, techniques, and applications across the research lifecycle\u2014including practical and ethical considerations. This will be followed by an extended online community of practice that offers resources and support as participants integrate GenAI into their own projects. By the end of the institute, participants will have developed the skills, judgment, and confidence to use GenAI in research and continue learning in this rapidly evolving field. The project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program, which is designed to build investigators' capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research. The project is also supported through a collaborative NSF activity with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the Walton Family Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
