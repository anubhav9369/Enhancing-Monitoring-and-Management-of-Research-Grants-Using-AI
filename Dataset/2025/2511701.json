 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs to acquire a Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) \u2013 tandem Time-of-Flight (ToF) mass spectrometer (MALDI-ToF/ToF MS) to enhance the research of investigators at seven different departments and centers at the University of Maine (UMaine) as well as at other Maine institutions. Macromolecules, such as polymers, peptides, proteins, and oligosaccharides, are one of the most widespread classes of materials, with important technological applications in biomedicine, chip manufacturing, energy, advanced manufacturing, and more. One of the key analytical techniques used to study macromolecular systems is mass spectrometry, in which the macromolecules are ionized, and their masses are very accurately measured. This method enables the researchers to understand the molecular composition, structure, and abundance of both biological and synthetic macromolecules. The state-of-the-art instrument is used mainly in mentored student research; it can be used also in courses to prepare and train students as the next generation of researchers and innovators. \r\n\r\nThe proposed MALDI-ToF/ToF MS uses soft-ionization and is highly suitable for analyzing sensitive analytes and large labile macromolecules. In this method the analyte is dispersed in a low molecular weight organic matrix and the resulting mixture is ionized by irradiation with a pulsed laser, leading to a rapid desorption of analyte and matrix ions in the gas phase. These ions are then accelerated and separated based on their mass (m)-to-charge (z) ratio, with the instrument calculating m/z values from the flight times, yielding highly accurate molecular weight information. This instrument supports multidisciplinary research teams from many research departments and centers at UMaine and at other Maine institutions (Bowdoin College, Colby College, and the University of New England). Several research groups are currently active in the field of biological (e.g., oligonucleotides, peptides, glycans, proteins) and synthetic macromolecules (e.g., polymers). The instrument supports and enhances current research activities in the fields of nanotechnology, biomaterials, biomedicine, electronics, and sustainable materials and composites. Access to a MALDI-ToF/ToF MS at UMaine allows for the advancement of current research projects and supports the initiation of new research, training, and collaboration, among researchers at UMaine and other regional institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
