 "awd_abstract_narration": "PRISTINE (Partnerships to Promote Research & Innovation for SocieTal Impact & Novel Engagements) is a collaboration among three primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) that are committed to developing academic-industry partnerships to enhance innovation and promote workforce development throughout their regions. The composition of the PRISTINE cohort \u2013 private and public universities, liberal arts and community colleges, urban and rural communities \u2013 positions the cohort well to engage and advance the economic viability of small and medium sized businesses not typically able to contribute to use-inspired research (UIR) and/or innovations made possible by emerging technologies. UIR is aimed at solving real-world problems, leading to faster and more effective solutions than any one organization could develop on its own. The effort will establish a community of practice that is designed to build capacity, especially at smaller institutions of higher education and PUIs, to develop, implement, and strengthen external research innovation partnerships in emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nPRISTINE will enhance the cohort\u2019s individual and collective capacities to: cultivate external partnerships that will attract research funding and facilitate UIR in emerging technology fields; leverage our expertise in experiential learning to develop credentialed workforce training programs; and support faculty and staff to deepen their expertise around grant seeking and technology transfer to increase the number of formal proposals and agreements between institutions and industry partners. The cohort intends to develop resources and training in these areas for faculty and industry partners, and disseminate their learnings through a public-facing virtual playbook/website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
