 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a pressing national need to develop a highly skilled biotechnology workforce capable of meeting the demands of rapidly evolving industries such as cell therapy and biomanufacturing. As the life sciences sector continues to expand, particularly in regional hubs like Frederick, Maryland, for example, there is growing urgency to train technicians who can support complex manufacturing, quality control, and regulatory processes. The project will prepare undergraduate and community college transfer students to meet these workforce demands by embedding hands-on, industry-aligned experiences into academic learning. It advances NSF\u2019s mission by promoting the progress of science and technology, strengthening regional and national economic competitiveness, and supporting practice-based education in high-impact STEM fields. By aligning education with employer needs and evolving job roles, this initiative also helps address the changing nature of work in the biotechnology sector.\r\n\r\nOver a three-year period, the project will engage students from Hood College, Frederick Community College, and Hagerstown Community College in Frederick, Maryland. Students will enroll in two newly developed laboratory-intensive courses, one focused on cell therapy and the other on biomanufacturing. Topics include mammalian cell culture, gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9, microbial fermentation, protein purification, microscopy, flow cytometry, and GMP-compliant documentation. Courses will be developed and continuously refined with input from regional biopharmaceutical partners to ensure alignment with workforce needs. Students will gain proficiency in working with bioreactors, biosafety cabinets, and analytical tools, while developing essential soft skills in teamwork, documentation, and communication. To bridge classroom learning with real-world applications, the program includes site visits, industry-led mini-courses, and paid summer internships with full support for housing and travel. The curriculum is being developed with an eye toward future alignment with industry-recognized certifications. The project team will also engage with InnovateBio, a national biotechnology education center, to adopt national best practices and explore becoming a designated hub site. Sustainability is integral to the project\u2019s design and will be supported through employer investment, regional workforce training partnerships, and the development of online and hybrid course delivery. As the program grows, it will strengthen academic-industry partnerships, support transfer student enrollment, and serve as a scalable model for skilled workforce training in biotechnology. By equipping students with competencies that are both academically rigorous and workforce-relevant this project will contribute to national efforts to close the technician skills gap and ensure the continued growth of the U.S. life sciences economy. The ExLENT Program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals to increase their interest in and access to career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
