 "awd_abstract_narration": "The USENIX Association presents conferences at the forefront of computing innovation and research that build collaborations between researchers and practitioners from industry, government, and academia. These events provide educational, mentorship, and networking opportunities of very high value to graduate students in the computer sciences who attend. To help increase the representation and participation of these students, this proposal provides funding to assist approximately 34 US-based graduate students to attend each of the following events:\r\n\r\n\u25cf 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC \u201825)\r\n\u25cf 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI \u201825)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge shared and advanced at these conferences has practical and meaningful application to many tools used in daily life, as well as to the ethical, cultural, and social ramifications of computing technology. This grant allows the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference and extends the impact of research presented to a broad audience of young researchers from across the country. USENIX is an open access organization, and all research and results presented and published at these events are freely available to the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
