 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop novel filters called ring-resonators, imprinted on silicon wafers, to suppress the atmospheric airglow at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths where cool stars, proto-planets and galaxies glow most brightly. The airglow, coming from narrow emission-lines produced by OH molecules in the upper atmosphere, prevent astronomers from taking full advantage of this window from ground-based observatories. The ring resonators create narrow-band notch filters (like an uneven picket fence with very narrow pickets), thermally tuned to block the air-glow lines but let most of the light from astronomical objects through. This program focuses on solving the engineering problems associated with coupling light from telescopes efficiently into the ring-resonators, and then back out to feed conventional instruments, such as spectrographs. By the conclusion of this project, leveraged by US industrial partners, the technology will be sufficiently advanced for on-sky demonstration of ring resonator-based air-glow suppression. Working with Lowell Observatory\u2019s Marley Foundation Astronomy Discovery Center, this program also will develop a portable, interactive exhibit focused on the critical thinking and the problem-solving tools used by scientists and engineers in the development of astronomical instrumentation.\r\n\r\nRing resonator filters currently offer the only viable alternative (potentially in a more compact package) to fiber Bragg gratings (not fabricated in the US) for reducing the pernicious airglow that limits ground-based NIR observations. The ring resonators developed here aim to suppress (by 20-40 dB) the most prominent OH lines, yielding an estimated signal to noise (S/N) improvement in the NIR of a factor of 5 or more in a broad-band sense, and dramatically reducing scattered light in astronomical instruments. Laboratory efforts focus on the integration of commercial off-the-shelf photonic lanterns into the source-device-sensor pathway; coupling both TE and TM input modes to photonic devices simultaneously; and leveraging the design, fabrication, and packaging expertise of industry leaders in silicon photonics, all for the purpose of mitigating the coupling losses that have thus far limited device throughput. The wavelength range over which OH suppression can be accomplished will also be expanded. The outreach exhibit will be centered upon existing instruments, some previously flown on SOFIA, and will be portable, allowing Lowell\u2019s Instrument Transport Vehicle to take it to other sites, such as the schools with which Lowell partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
