 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southeastern Community College (SCC), located in Whiteville, North Carolina, will collaborate with area high schools, businesses, and industry to prepare and employ skilled and highly qualified Electric Vehicle (EV) technicians to address the significant demand for skilled technicians to service and maintain EVs in North Carolina and across the nation. The proposed EV Technology curriculum, integrated with SCC\u2019s existing automotive technology program, will offer traditional community college students, dual-enrolled high school students, and incumbent workers the opportunity to earn a certificate in EV Technology. In addition to providing students with an SCC degree or certificate, the project will collaborate with industry partners to connect students with work-based learning and apprenticeship opportunities that will significantly enhance student retention, completion rates, and job placement outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to address the growing demand for skilled EV technicians in the region and the nation with the achievement of the following goals: (1) Enhance SCC\u2019s existing automotive program to create a dedicated EV technician pathway for students entering the workforce, and (2) Expand the college\u2019s dual enrollment initiatives by partnering with the four local high schools to offer EV Technology coursework at their sites. Within the first two years of the EV Technology program's launch, at least 20 students are expected to be enrolled annually. To achieve these goals, SCC's automotive instructors will undergo training in EV technology, acquire and install EV equipment, and design a curriculum that aligns with the needs of local employers. Pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship opportunities will be integrated into the EV Technology curriculum, ensuring students gain practical experience. Additionally, high school automotive instructors will receive specialized training through summer workshops. Recruitment efforts will focus on all students at SCC using a multi-faceted approach to attract a diverse group of participants. Through these actions, the college will ensure participants are thoroughly prepared as highly qualified, career-ready EV technicians. The results of this project will serve as a model for other small, rural community colleges, providing a framework for them to prepare students for the expanding EV workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
